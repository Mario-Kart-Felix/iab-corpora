<BLOCKQUOTE>
Diesel engines are more durable and heavier than gasoline engines.  
In addition, they are more fuel efficient than gasoline engines, in part 
because the higher compression ratios found in diesel engines help 
convert a higher percentage of the fuel into power.  Because of their 
greater durability and efficiency, diesel engines are used to power 
most of the Nation's heavy vehicles and equipment.<P>

Diesel mechanics repair and maintain diesel engines that power 
transportation equipment, such as heavy trucks, buses, and 
locomotives; construction equipment such as bulldozers, cranes, and 
road graders; and farm equipment such as tractors and combines.  A 
small number work on diesel-powered automobiles.  Diesel 
mechanics also service a variety of other diesel-powered equipment, 
such as electric generators and compressors and pumps used in oil 
well drilling and irrigation systems.<P>

Most diesel mechanics work on heavy trucks used in industries 
such as mining and construction to carry ore and building materials, 
and by private and commercial trucking lines for general freight 
hauling.  Most light trucks are gasoline powered, and although some 
diesel mechanics may occasionally service gasoline engines, most 
work primarily on diesel engines.  (For information on mechanics 
who work primarily on gasoline engines, see the <CITE>Handbook</CITE> statement 
on <A HREF="182.htm">automotive mechanics</A>.)<P>

Mechanics who work for organizations that maintain their own 
vehicles may spend much time doing preventive maintenance to 
assure safe operation, prevent wear and damage to parts, and reduce 
costly breakdowns.  During a maintenance check on a truck, for 
example, they usually follow a regular checklist that includes the 
inspection of brake systems, steering mechanisms, wheel bearings, 
and other important parts.  They usually repair or adjust a part that is 
not working properly.  Parts that cannot be fixed are replaced.<P>

In many shops, mechanics do all kinds of repairs, working on a 
vehicle's electrical system one day and doing major engine repairs the 
next.  In some large shops, mechanics specialize in one or two types 
of work.  For example, one mechanic may specialize in major engine 
repair, another in transmission work, another in electrical systems, 
and yet another in suspension or brake systems.<P>

Diesel mechanics use a variety of tools in their work, including 
power tools such as pneumatic wrenches to remove bolts quickly; 
machine tools such as lathes and grinding machines to rebuild brakes
and other parts; welding and flame-cutting equipment to remove and 
repair exhaust systems and other parts; common handtools such as 
screwdrivers, pliers, and wrenches to work on small parts and get at 
hard-to-reach places; and jacks and hoists to lift and move large 
parts.  Diesel mechanics also use a variety of testing equipment, 
including ohmmeters, ammeters, and voltmeters when working on 
electrical systems and electronic components; and tachometers, 
dynamometers, and engine analyzers to locate engine malfunctions.<P>

For heavy work, such as removing engines and transmissions, two 
mechanics may work as a team, or a mechanic may be assisted by an 
apprentice or helper.  Mechanics generally get their assignments from 
shop supervisors or service managers, who may check the mechanics' 
work or assist in diagnosing problems.<P>

<LI><H4><A HREF="24.htm#cond">Working Conditions</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Diesel mechanics usually work indoors, although they may 
occasionally make repairs on the road.  They are subject to the usual 
shop hazards such as cuts and bruises.  Mechanics handle greasy and 
dirty parts and may stand or lie in awkward or cramped positions to 
repair vehicles and equipment.  Work areas usually are well lighted, 
heated, and ventilated, and many employers provide locker rooms 
and shower facilities.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><H4><A HREF="24.htm#emply">Employment</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Diesel mechanics held about 250,000 jobs in 1994.  Nearly 
one-quarter serviced trucks and other diesel-powered equipment for 
customers of vehicle and equipment dealers, leasing companies, and 
independent automotive repair shops.  Over one-fifth worked for 
local and long-distance trucking companies, and nearly one-seventh 
maintained the buses and trucks of buslines, public transit companies, 
school systems, and Federal, State, and local government.  The 
remainder maintained the fleets of trucks and other equipment of 
manufacturing, construction, and other companies.  A relatively small 
number were self-employed.<P>

Diesel mechanics are employed in every section of the country, 
but most work in towns and cities where trucking companies, 
buslines, and other fleet owners have large repair shops.<P>

<LI><H4><A HREF="24.htm#training">Training</A>, Other Qualifications, and Advancement</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although many persons are able to qualify for diesel mechanic jobs 
through years of on-the-job training in related, lesser skilled 
positions, training authorities recommend that persons seeking diesel 
mechanic jobs complete a formal diesel mechanic training program.  
Diesel technology is becoming more sophisticated and diesel engines 
increasingly use electronic components to control a growing variety 
of functions.  Knowledge of basic electronics is becoming essential 
for diesel mechanics to diagnose whether a malfunction is caused by 
an electronic component or whether it can be traced to another 
source.  Most employers prefer to hire graduates of formal training 
programs in diesel mechanics, and completion of such a program can 
speed advancement to the journey mechanic level.  These 1- to 2-year 
programs, given by vocational and technical schools and community 
and junior colleges, lead to a certificate of completion or an associate 
degree.  They provide a foundation in the basics of the latest diesel 
technology and electronics, and enable trainees to more quickly 
master the service and repair of the actual vehicles and equipment 
encountered on the job.<P>

A formal 4-year apprenticeship is another good way to learn 
diesel mechanics.  However, apprenticeships are becoming less 
common because employers are reluctant to make such a long-term 
investment in training, especially when graduates of postsecondary 
diesel mechanic programs are increasing in number.  Competition for 
the limited number of apprenticeship slots is often extremely keen.  
Typical apprenticeship programs for diesel truck and bus mechanics 
consist of approximately 8,000 hours of practical experience working 
on transmissions, engines, and other components and at least 576 
hours of formal instruction to learn blueprint reading, mathematics, 
engine theory, and safety.  Frequently, these programs include 
training in both diesel and gasoline engine repair.<P>

Even though most employers prefer to hire graduates of formal 
post secondary training programs in diesel mechanics, the number of 
persons who complete such programs are too few to meet their needs.  
As a result, many diesel mechanics still learn their skills on the job.  
Unskilled beginners usually do tasks such as cleaning parts, fueling, 
lubricating, and driving vehicles in and out of the shop.  As beginners 
gain experience and as vacancies become available, they usually are 
promoted to mechanics' helpers.  In some shops, 
beginners&#151;especially those having automobile service experience&#151;start as 
mechanics' helpers.<P>

Most helpers can perform routine service tasks and make minor 
repairs after a few months' experience.  They advance to increasingly 
difficult jobs as they prove their ability.  After they master the repair 
and service of diesel engines, they learn to work on related 
components such as brakes, transmissions, or electrical systems.  
Generally, at least 3 to 4 years of on-the-job experience is necessary 
to qualify as an all-round diesel truck or bus mechanic.  Additional 
training on other components, such as hydraulic systems,  may be 
necessary for mechanics who wish to specialize in other types of 
diesel equipment.<P>

For unskilled entry level jobs, employers generally look for 
applicants who have mechanical aptitude and are at least 18 years of 
age and in good physical condition.  Completion of high school is 
required by a growing number of employers.  Courses in automotive 
repair, electronics, English, mathematics, and physics provide a good 
basic educational background for a career as a diesel mechanic.  
Good reading and basic mathematics skills are needed to study 
technical manuals to keep abreast of new technology and learn new 
service and repair procedures and specifications.  A State commercial 
driver's license is needed for test driving trucks or buses on public 
roads.  Practical experience in automobile repair in a gasoline service 
station, in the Armed Forces, or as a hobby also is valuable.<P>

Employers sometimes send experienced mechanics to special 
training classes conducted by truck, bus, diesel engine, parts, and 
equipment manufacturers where they learn the latest technology or 
receive special training in subjects such as diagnosing engine 
malfunctions.  Mechanics also must read service and repair manuals 
to keep abreast of engineering changes.<P>

Voluntary certification by the National Institute for Automotive 
Service Excellence (ASE) is recognized as a standard of achievement 
for diesel mechanics.  Mechanics may be certified as Master Heavy-
Duty Truck Technician or may be certified in one or more of six 
different areas of heavy-duty truck repair: brakes, gasoline engines, 
diesel engines, drive trains, electrical systems, and suspension and 
steering.  For certification in each area, mechanics must pass a 
written examination and have at least 2 years of experience.  High 
school, vocational or trade school, or community or junior college 
training in gasoline or diesel engine repair may substitute for up to 1 
year of experience.  To retain certification, mechanics must retake the 
tests at least every 5 years.<P>

Most mechanics must buy their own handtools.  Experienced 
mechanics often have thousands of dollars invested in tools.<P>

Experienced mechanics who have leadership ability may advance 
to shop supervisors or service managers.  Mechanics who have sales 
ability sometimes become sales representatives.  A few mechanics 
open their own repair shops.<P>

<LI><H4><A HREF="24.htm#outlook">Job Outlook</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Employment of diesel mechanics is expected to increase 
<A HREF="238.htm">about as fast as the average</A> 
for all occupations through the year 2005.  Because 
this is a large occupation, more job openings are expected for diesel 
mechanics than for most other occupations.  Although employment 
growth will create many new jobs, most job openings will arise from 
the need to replace diesel mechanics who transfer to other fields of 
work or retire or stop working for other reasons.<P>

Employment of diesel mechanics is expected to grow as freight 
transportation by truck increases.  More trucks will be needed for 
both local and intercity hauling due to the increased production of 
goods.  Additional diesel mechanics will be needed to repair and 
maintain growing numbers of buses and heavy construction graders, 
cranes, earthmovers, and other equipment.  Due to the greater 
durability and economy of the diesel relative to the gasoline engine, 
buses and trucks of all sizes are expected to be increasingly powered 
by diesels, also creating new jobs for diesel mechanics.<P>

Careers in diesel mechanics are attractive to many because wages 
are relatively high and skilled repair work is challenging and varied.  
Opportunities should be good for persons who complete formal 
training in diesel mechanics at community and junior colleges and 
vocational and technical schools, but others may face competition for 
entry level jobs.<P>

<LI><H4><A HREF="24.htm#earnings">Earnings</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
According to a survey of workplaces in over 160 metropolitan areas, 
diesel mechanics earned median earnings of $14.61 an hour in 1993.  
The middle 50 percent earned between $12.00 and $17.49 an hour.  
However, earnings may vary by industry and by geographic location.<P>

Beginning apprentices usually earn from 50 to 75 percent of the 
rate of skilled workers and receive increases about every 6 months 
until they complete their apprenticeship and reach the rate of skilled 
mechanics.<P>

The majority of mechanics work a standard 40 hour week, 
although many work as many as 70 hours per week, particularly if 
they are self employed.  Those employed by truck and bus firms 
which provide service around the clock may work evenings, nights, 
and weekends.  They usually receive a higher rate of pay for this work.<P>

Many diesel mechanics are members of labor unions, including 
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; 
the Amalgamated Transit Union; the International Union, United 
Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of 
America; the Transport Workers Union of America; the Sheet Metal 
Workers' International Association; and the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters.<P>
