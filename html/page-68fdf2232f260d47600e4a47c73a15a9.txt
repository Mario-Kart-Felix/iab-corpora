		<h2 id="anchor-top"></h2><h2>Your Roadside Assistance Guidelines</h2><p>Your AAA Southern Pennsylvania membership entitles you to AAA’s renowned 24-hour Roadside Assistance. By familiarizing yourself with the following benefits, you’ll appreciate the scope and value of your prepaid services. We remind you that these benefits are for Roadside Assistance and should not be used as a substitute for maintenance or as a repair service. Be sure to keep this information in your vehicle’s glove box for handy reference. You can download and print a version of this guide <a href="http://southpa.aaa.com/FetchFile.ashx?id=65893d4b-e369-4dd1-ae15-5700cd9aface" target="_new">here</a>.</p><div class="subcol1"><ul class="bullet gradient1"><li><a href="#anchor-service">Who Provides Service?</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-covered">Who Is Covered?</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-eligible">Eligible Vehicles</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-comments">Service Comments</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-roadside">Roadside Services</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-allowable">Allowable Service Calls</a></li></ul></div><div class="subcol2"><ul class="bullet gradient1"><li><a href="#anchor-alternate">Alternate Service</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-check">Emergency Repair Check Acceptance</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-vehicle">If You Cannot Be With Your Vehicle</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-trip">Trip Interruption</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-obtain">How to Obtain Service</a></li><li><a href="#anchor-call">When You Call</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="anchor-service">Who Provides Service?</h2><p>Roadside Assistance is performed by independent service facilities, which are not employed by AAA. AAA has attempted to secure reliable, competent facilities to service the needs of its members; however, AAA cannot be responsible for the negligence, misfeasance, nonperformance or any other act performed by the service facilities or their employees who are independent contractors and at no time are to be considered agents of AAA. The Club will assist by mediating unresolved issues. We select independent service facilities for their ability to handle service calls, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will always have the parts and equipment to make repairs. When your vehicle cannot be made operable upon providing the services listed here, AAA Southern Pennsylvania will assist you in finding the nearest open place of repair. If a repair facility cannot be located, AAA Southern Pennsylvania will assist you in obtaining, at your expense, lodging or alternative transportation.</p><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><h2 id="anchor-covered">Who is Covered?</h2><p>AAA membership covers you, the member, not your vehicle. Service will not be provided to a nonmember even if he is in possession of and driving a member’s car. After 72 hours of becoming a new AAA member (or AAA Plus member), your Roadside Assistance privileges are activated. At this time, you will be able to obtain Roadside Assistance for any eligible vehicle that you are driving or riding in at the time of disablement.</p><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><h2 id="anchor-eligible"><strong>Eligible Vehicles</strong></h2><p>AAA Southern Pennsylvania shall provide service for the following (please click the below button for all coverage items):</p><div class="button-alt"><a href="/FetchFile.ashx?id=5e282ea5-09bf-4723-99e0-34d5e1d5cf36" title="Vehicle Eligibility Chart Dec 2010">Vehicle Eligibility Chart</a></div><p> </p><p>Vehicle Eligibility is defined as all properly licensed and inspected (not currently abandoned, illegally parked or impounded due to an infraction of a local ordinance), four-wheeled motor vehicles of the passenger, pleasure or recreational type, regardless of license plate designation, if those services can be safely delivered. If a vehicle that has been altered or modified requires additional time and/or materials, the Roadside Assistance facility can charge for this service.</p><div class="bordered"></div><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><h2 id="anchor-comments"><strong>Service Comments</strong></h2><p>It is our goal to provide you with the highest level of Roadside Assistance available. Service may vary from club to club, but at no time will service to AAA-affiliated club members throughout the U.S. and Canada be less than quality standards required by National AAA. Help us maintain these high standards of Roadside Assistance. Any comments you may have will enable us to continually improve our services.</p><p>Please address your comments to:<br /><br /><strong>AAA Southern Pennsylvania, Attn: Automotive Services, 2840 Eastern Boulevard, York PA 17402, or you may <a href="mailto:webmaster@aaasp.aaa.com">contact us online</a>.</strong></p><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><h2 id="anchor-roadside"><strong>Roadside Services</strong></h2><p><strong>Mechanical Adjustments:</strong><br />Minor/temporary adjustments will be made in an attempt to enable your vehicle to operate safely under its own power. Cost of parts or materials is at the owner’s expense. If the car cannot be started, towing service will be provided.<br /><br /><strong>Battery Boost:</strong><br />A battery boost will be provided in an attempt to start your vehicle.<br /><br /><strong>Battery Replacement Service:</strong><br />In selected areas, when a AAA member calls for assistance or submits a request online and the problem is believed to be battery-related, a mobile battery-replacement vehicle may be dispatched. A trained specialist will test the battery and the vehicle charging system. If the battery needs to be replaced, the member can request to purchase one, and the specialist will install one on the spot.<br /><br /><strong>Tire Service:</strong><br />If your vehicle’s spare is inflated and serviceable, it will be installed to replace a flat tire. If no inflated spare or serviceable tire is available, the vehicle will be towed. It is not recommended to use spare tires with excessive rust around the wheel-mounting surface.<br /><br /><strong>Extrication and Winching Service:</strong><br />Your vehicle will be extricated/winched when it can be safely reached from a state or locally maintained road or established thoroughfare by a service vehicle. If additional help is needed, you may opt to pay for additional services, and the contractor may utilize additional persons or equipment (where available) that are needed to free your vehicle.<br />AAA Plus provides coverage to include the delivery of services by a second truck and operator for one (1) hour at the scene.<br /><br /><strong>Service does not include or extend to:</strong></p><ul class="bullet"><li>Snowbound vehicle recovery. (Service providers are not required to shovel snow, mud, dirt or sand to clear obstructed roadways or driveways; or enter areas unsuitable for vehicular traffic.)</li><li>Recovery of vehicles that are driven off regularly traveled roads, such as on beaches, vacant lots, playgrounds, creek beds, open fields, boat ramps or forest.</li></ul><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><p><strong>Towing Services</strong></p><p>When your vehicle cannot be safely driven after attempting any of the listed roadside services, unless prohibited by law, your vehicle will be towed one time per disablement at no charge to your choice of one of the following:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>To the Roadside Assistance facility rendering the service.</li><li>To a maximum of three (3) miles in any direction from the point of disablement.</li><li>If the vehicle requires towing, the member or designated agent may be required to accompany the tow driver to the tow destination. We reserve the right to refuse a tow from a repair facility.</li><li>Charges for service that exceeds the benefits listed will be at the prevailing hourly or mileage rate of the region where service is provided. Additional miles are payable by the member to the responding facility.</li></ul><p>Although AAA offers 24-hour coast-to-coast service, it cannot guarantee timely service under all conditions and circumstances or at a high demand period when the Club and Roadside Assistance facilities are overtaxed. Delays are sometimes unavoidable.</p><p>AAA Plus provides up to 100 miles of free towing in any direction from the point of disablement to the destination of your choice.</p><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><p><strong>Accident Towing</strong></p><p>Service will be provided to the member in accordance with AAA Southern Pennsylvania Towing Service. To avoid any delay of covered services when there are any injuries, property damage or a nondrivable vehicle, we will inquire at the time of your call if the police have been notified of the accident. For liability purposes, the Roadside Assistance provider will require a police officer or an incident report to be present prior to him servicing and/or towing a vehicle from an accident scene when there are any injuries or property damage. It is hoped that this service is never needed, but if any accident occurs, please report your incident to the appropriate authorities prior to calling AAA.</p><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><p><strong>Lockout Service</strong></p><p>If your keys are locked inside the vehicle, service will be sent to gain entrance. If the key that operates or provides access to the passenger compartment of the vehicle is lost, broken or the service provider cannot gain entrance to your vehicle, locksmith service up to $50 or reimbursement for commercial locksmith service up to $50 will be provided. In cases in which the vehicle cannot be made operable, towing services will be provided in accordance with AAA Southern Pennsylvania towing provision. AAA Plus provides added coverage or reimbursement up to $100 in parts and labor for locksmith service, if such service is required to unlock your vehicle or make it operable.</p><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><p><strong>Fuel Delivery</strong></p><p>A limited supply of fuel will be delivered to your disabled vehicle to enable you to reach the nearest open service station.

In the best interest of our members, the activity of roadside assistance is monitored to ensure a reasonably priced membership. A membership used three (3) or more times a year within three consecutive years for road service is defined as an excessive roadside assistance user and will be reviewed by Club Management. AAA Southern Pennsylvania reserves the right to deny renewal of membership or cancel a membership at any time.</p><p><a href="#anchor-top">Return to Top</a></p><h2 id="anchor-alternate"><strong>Alternate Service</strong></h2><p>If you have followed the procedure outlined to obtain Roadside Assistance and AAA service is not available, or AAA contractor access is restricted (toll roads, limited access highways), the Club will provide reimbursement for covered services at the prevailing commercial rate for the region.
