Electronic billboards can display video and occasionally run tweets or Facebook comments from fans, but they don't react dynamically in the same way as online and mobile advertising.

The Japanese automaker is aiming to have such driverless autos on the road by 2020. &quot;Nissan Motor Company's willingness to question conventional thinking and to drive progress is what sets us apart,&quot; said CEO Carlos Ghosn, in a press release. &quot;In 2007 I pledged that –- by 2010 –- Nissan would mass market a zero-emission vehicle. Today, the Nissan Leaf is the best-selling electric vehicle in history.</p>

With an install base by the end of the year in the millions, outdoor advertisers will have the license to try out some more interactive advertising. Imagine a billboard that dispenses coupons or one that shows different ads depending on who walks by. Or perhaps there wouldn't be a billboard at all -- just a small device transmitting offers to your phone. \n\nFor the uninitiated, Near Field Communication is a mobile technology that allows for the transmission of data within the space of a few inches. NFC has had some notable adoption among mobile phone manufacturers, such as Samsung, while Apple has remained a holdout. \n\nAt this point, Apple has not yet confirmed whether NFC will be included in its upcoming phone. (Apple hasn't even confirmed that it's launching a phone.) \n\nHowever, rumors have surfaced that the iPhone 5S will include an NFC reader. Such a move is plausible since NFC was said to be included in the original designs of the iPhone 4S but later removed.\n\nGiven the unpredictable nature of Apple releases, outdoor advertisers aren't necessarily banking on an NFC-enabled iPhone 5S, but they are cautiously optimistic. Suzanne Grimes, president and COO of Clear Channel Outdoors America, says at the very least, NFC outdoor ads can improve on the QR code. \"QR codes are little clunky,\" she says. \"We are focusing on NFC because it's really elegant.\" \n\nJeff Jenkins, CEO of CBN Campus Media, which has run NFC-enabled ads on college campuses, says he's excited about the new iPhone. \"It's a big, big deal,\" he says. \"It opens up a whole new world of content.\" Jenkins says that the majority of responses to NFC-enabled ads have been via iPhones that used QR codes to access the same data.\n\nClear Channel has more than 1,000 large format digital billboards in 37 markets in the United States. The company is working with Verizon Wireless Precision Marketing and AT&T Mobility Consumer Insights to see how consumers react to digital advertising. Among the scenarios Grimes envisions with NFC-enabled outdoor advertising are billboards that change their messages as consumers walk by. \n\nAn outdoor ad can also augment a message. For instance, if you're listening to iHeartRadio on your phone and hear an ad for Red Bull, the billboard you're walking past can run a Red Bull ad.\n\n\"This is doable right now,\" Grimes says. \n\nYet a relatively sparse amount of NFC-enabled ad campaigns have run in the U.S. Perhaps the most famous was the one below for the Samsung Galaxy SIII in 2012, which gave users who tapped their phone against the ad a free song from the Goodie Mob: \n\nOther countries are much more experimental with NFC-enabled outdoor advertising. For instance, Meat & Livestock Australia recently launched ads there that display different recipes depending on the weather. When it's hot, the billboards show recipes for beef salad, but when temperatures cool, it subs in beef stew recipes. \n\nFrench supermarket chain Les Belles Feuilles offers NFC-enabled shelf labels that provide information on 25,000 products in store.\n\nIn the short term, an audience of millions of consumers with NFC-enabled iPhones will boost the technology. However, even Grimes couldn't say whether NFC would have staying power. \n\n\"The way tech changes, I'd be loath to say that,\" she says. \"Just like there QR code and then NFC was better and faster, there might be something else.\" \n\nImage: Getty, Philippe Lopez"},"shares":{"twitter":641,"facebook":103,"linked_in":50,"google_plus":8,"total":802},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3LzI0L0ludGVyYWN0aXZlLjllNmJjLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/62acf777/0c0/Interactive-Billboard.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3LzI0L0ludGVyYWN0aXZlLjllNmJjLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/f3eb0916/0c0/Interactive-Billboard.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/18YqlSe","choice":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"best-iphone-chargers"}]},"excerpt":"Amid the digital revolution, outdoor advertising has remained stubbornly resistant to change.

Engberg shared his thoughts on the startup's scaling strategies in a recent chat, many lessons of which today's budding entrepreneurs can learn from.\n\n1. Start Companies With People You Know\n\nImage: flickr, Evernote\n\nThe technology behind Evernote was developed by Russian scientist Stepan Pachikov, who, in 2005, began working on tech that would enable people to have a \"secondary brain\" for remembering everything. It just so happens, at the time Pachikov was developing the backend for such a system, future Evernote CEO Phil Libin was looking to start his own mass-market, memory-focused startup. In his due diligence, he discovered and fell in love with the idea of Evernote and was invited to bring the yet-to-exist product to market as CEO.\n\nIn putting together the core team, Libin recruited people he had previously worked with, people with complementary strengths and concentrated expertise whom he knew would fit well on a team.\n\nCTO Dave Engberg, for example, has served as CTO of Libin's previous venture, government and enterprise security systems company CoreStreet, and had moved to the Boston area for that project. Likewise, also recruited from the previous CoreStreet team was Andrew Sinkov, who joined Evernote as head of marketing and is someone Libin \"had known forever,\" Engberg said.\n\nEngberg, focused on tech, of course, enticed colleague Philip Constantinou to join as head of product and engineering. And the list goes on.\n\n\"We took in people we knew, so that we could take the idea and turn it around fairly quickly,\" says Engberg. \"If we had had to go out and start hiring off of Craigslist and Monster, it would have been six months before we had people up to speed. Hiring people we knew we wanted to work with and trusted was crucial to launching on time.\"\n\n\"You know what each other is good at, and you know the responsibilities each person takes on, they\u2019ll get done. That way, you can focus on what you do best,\" says Engberg. \"I don't worry, for example, that marketing lead, Andrew, will put something crazy on the company blog, and he, in turn, need not worry about how we're tuning our SSDs on our servers to make the databases faster. He can assume we're doing the right things.\"\n\n2. Cut Costs and Time With Commodity Hardware and Open-Source Software \n\nThough 99% of startups should run their businesses in a cloud environment -- via services such as Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure or Rackspace Cloud -- Evernote runs off of its own hardware.\n\nWhile he doesn't recommend most startups run their own equipment, his team has cut costs with this method through establishing good relationships with vendors who can provide high quality, commodity-grade equipment -- essentially high-end, consumer-style hardware, he says. Instead of customizing, they try to go off-the-shelf as much as possible.\n\nLikewise, the team mostly uses open-source software, including mySQL, Java and various Apache products, so that it minimizes costs associated with commercial software products. Currently, Evernote really only pays for some analytics tools it uses and some licensed image-processing code for extracting Asian language text from pictures, Engberg says.\n\n3. Focus on Scaling Good People\n\nImage: flickr, Evernote\n\n\"The hardest thing to scale is good people,\" says Engberg. Evernote runs its business so that it needs fewer good people who are then increasingly more productive. Automation is essential, as is building monitoring, analytic and remedy methods for necessary, but time-consuming processes. All startups should focus their time on optimizing those things that are unique to their business, that can't be easily replicated elsewhere, Engberg says.\n\n\"If you were starting a dot-com back in the 1990s, a lot of the costs for your company would have been infrastructure, bandwidth, things like that. You would have spent a lot of time figuring out how to pay less for database software. There have been so many changes in the industry that turned that equation on its head. For the things you're scaling up these days, the software tends to be free. The hardware has gotten to good commodity price points. Bandwidth is priced fairly reasonable.\" An entrepreneur's focus, then, should be finding and keeping good people, he says.\n\nEvernote works hard to make sure its employees' time is used as productively as possible, and that the things they're doing outside of work also enhance their professional and personal lives. For example, Evernote offers a subsidy for headquarter employees to buy electric cars, which enable them to drive in the carpool lane, saving time on their commutes. Furthermore, Evernote caters daily lunches, so that employees spend less time out to lunch, as well.\n\nBeing as efficient as possible with its people has enabled the company to grow to its current point, and this focus is also fueling a work culture that is still pushing the company along.\n\n4. With Cross-Platform, Focus on the API and Area Experts\n\nImage: flickr, Evernote\n\nWhen Evernote launched its invitation-only beta in February 2008, it was available on a number of clients, including web, mobile web, Macintosh, Windows and Windows Mobile. Upon public launch in June 2008, the app already had 10,000-20,000 early adopters signed up and using the app, fueled mostly by powers users of Windows shareware application called Evernote, developed by eventual Evernote (as we know it today) co-founder Stepan Pachikov. From there, increased smartphone usage rates and the advent of the modern app store fueled continued user growth for the company.\n\nEvernote wouldn't have been as set up for success, though, if its development team hadn't focused on cross-platform accessibility early on, determining that it would be advantageous to build a synchronization API first and use that to build interfaces, says Engberg.\n\nFurthermore, knowing that the company was going to need a Windows client, a Mac client and so on, the dev team was set up in platform-specific teams, so that each team could focus on the platform they know best. That way, Mac devs aren't worrying about learning how to develop for Windows from scratch, and vice versa.\n\nAgain, Engberg stresses that the focus was on finding people who had previous experience developing and launching platform-specific apps. \"It wasn't their first rodeo. They had done some programming at scale before, so that the hard knocks you typically learn along the way, someone else had already paid them to learn that, somewhere else. There have been some other tech startups that have been successful, starting from some kid in a Harvard dorm, whipping together some PHP. But, we're probably the counter-example of bringing together a few seasoned veterans to try to make the playoffs,\" he says. \"We didn't have to go through the rookie mistakes. We just plowed right through.\"\n\n5. Build Something You Want to Use\n\nPerhaps the most counterintuitive piece of advice offered by seasoned entrepreneurs is to just build something you want to use. Evernote wasn't influenced by focus groups or user testing, says Engberg. Its diverse team of co-founders were just hardcore users, and they made sure they weren't putting out something they hated, he says.\n\nThe iPhone and iPad, for example, weren't developed with user feedback in mind. They were revolutionary devices dreamt up by Apple, based on how Steve Jobs and his colleagues thought people would be using devices in the future.\n\n\"It's kind of boring to go home to the family reunion and be asked about what you do, only to respond that you build cryptography software used by the Department of Energy and other three-letter agencies, which was our last company. We wanted to build something we were excited to use and talk about. We wanted our friends to use it and think it was helpful and cool,\" he says. \"So, we built something we wanted to use. And by luck, it turned out that other people wanted to use it, too.\"\n\nToday, the company is continually focused on improving its product, putting most of its spending into product development: Developers, designers, QA, managers, testers, support people and operations people. If anything, Evernote is a case for hiring seasoned experts and digging deep within their strengths to build a product that impresses, no matter what platform it's found on.\n\nImages: Mashable composite, iStockphoto, befehr, bulentgultek, and Evernote"},"shares":{"twitter":777,"facebook":83,"linked_in":104,"google_plus":15,"pinterest":1,"total":980},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3L2M2L2V2ZXJub3RlYXJ0LjE5ZjcwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/9ade9af1/1cf/evernote-art-final2.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3L2M2L2V2ZXJub3RlYXJ0LjE5ZjcwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/33ee7193/1cf/evernote-art-final2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/12I1ukT","choice":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"With 65 million users and more than 6,500 businesses using its app, Evernote has come a long way since its core team came together in 2007.","channel":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/"},{"_id":"521ce003b589e4349000051f","id":"2013/08/27/twitter-hires-nathan-hubbard","title":"Twitter Hires Commerce Chief to Add Shopping","title_tag":null,"author":"Bloomberg","post_date":"2013-08-27T17:21:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 17:21:02 +0000","sort_key":"1veovn","link":"http://mashable.com/2013/08/27/twitter-hires-nathan-hubbard/","content":{"plain":"Twitter Inc. hired Nathan Hubbard, the former president of Ticketmaster, as its first head of commerce, part of a push to enable shopping via short postings on its social website.\n\nHubbard, 38, started at San Francisco-based Twitter this week, said Jim Prosser, a spokesman for the online social service. As commerce chief, Hubbard will report to Adam Bain, Twitter\u2019s head of global revenue. Hubbard left Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV)\u2019s Ticketmaster unit earlier this month amid an overhaul of its online services.\n\nTwitter is seeking new sources of revenue as it prepares for a potential initial public offering and targets $1 billion in 2014 sales. In its first foray into e-commerce, projected by Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) to be a $370 billion market in the U.S. by 2017, Twitter plans to offer retailers tools for selling goods and services inside tweets, Hubbard said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to people who have stuff to sell and help them use Twitter to sell it more effectively,\u201d Hubbard said.\n\nHubbard will look to team up with merchants and providers of payment services rather than compete with those companies, and may take a percentage of any transactions on its site, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the hallmarks of Twitter\u2019s entire approach has been partnering,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take the same approach with owners of physical and digital goods.\u201d\n\nHubbard, a Princeton University graduate with a masters in business administration from Stanford University, was formerly a touring and recording artist, and has released five albums.\n\nOnline Shopping\n\nBy enabling shopping via Twitter\u2019s site and mobile applications, the company is seeking to keep users on the site for longer and to learn more about their interests. Data about online-shopping habits would be valuable to advertisers, who contribute the bulk of Twitter\u2019s estimated $582.8 million in ad sales this year, according to EMarketer Inc.\n\nEarlier this month, Twitter said it\u2019s working with research firm Datalogix Inc. to track when advertisements on the site, called Promoted Tweets, lead to purchases in brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nWhile Twitter Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo has said that management isn\u2019t concentrating on an IPO, the company is widely predicted to hold a share sale before long to help it bankroll expansion, and give early investors a way to realize financial gains on their holdings.\n\nThe CEO has bolstered his management team, promoting Ali Rowghani to chief operating officer, adding finance veteran Mike Gupta and hiring former Morgan Stanley executive Cynthia Gaylor to run corporate development.\n\nAt Ticketmaster, Hubbard had been overseeing a $75 million overhaul of the unit\u2019s online technology to make the service easier to use for consumers and venue owners. He joined Live Nation in after the concert promoter bought a majority of Musictoday, an online merchandising company where Hubbard was CEO.\n\nImage: Rick Diamond/Getty Images for IEBA"},"shares":{"linked_in":38,"twitter":498,"facebook":47,"stumble_upon":8,"google_plus":10,"pinterest":1,"total":602},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3LzcxL0h1YmJhcmQuMTIwOTMuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMjAweDExNSMKZQlqcGc/1ef180a5/b3f/Hubbard.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3LzcxL0h1YmJhcmQuMTIwOTMuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNDAweDIzMCMKZQlqcGc/f8d520f3/b3f/Hubbard.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1aMEHZS","choice":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Twitter Inc. hired Nathan Hubbard, the former president of Ticketmaster, as its first head of commerce, part of a push to enable shopping via short postings on its social website.

Stream Ads, which have thus far appeared solely on the Yahoo homepage and Yahoo News, mimic the format of the content surrounding it: In the case of Yahoo News, ads appear in the form of a thumbnail, linked headline and a few lines of text; a sponsored tag and yellow background are the only markers that the content is paid for (see image below).\n\nThe second ad unit, Billboard, is a large display unit that runs across the top of Yahoo's desktop homepage. Like this billboard ad from the New York Times, this unit allows advertisers to add an extra layer of interactivity. An ad for an upcoming film could include a widget for purchasing tickets within the ad or include multiple links to third-party websites.\n\nIn addition to the newly redesigned sites, the ads will also now appear on the desktop and Android app for Yahoo Mail. In Mail, ads will appear at the top of users' inboxes -- similar, we imagine, to the ads that appear at the top of the \"Promotions\" tab in Gmail. (And yes, they're likely to be just as annoying.)\n\nA Yahoo spokesperson declined to provide any information about the performance of its Stream and Billboard ads thus far, but the company is no doubt hoping the units will help stem continued declines in its core display advertising business.

If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here.\n\nFor every action there is a reaction. And for the meteoric rise of fast-fashion chains like Zara and H&M -- whose manufacturing processes have been subject to close scrutiny as of late -- a growing roster of startups aims to deliver apparel and accessories that are fashionable, affordable and, equally important, ethically sourced.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zady joins that movement with the launch of an ecommerce site featuring around 150 fashion and home products for women and men, all adhering to the company's ethical manufacturing standards. The goods are stylish and, from what we've seen, well-made, with photographs that emphasize the quality of their craftsmanship above all else. Prices are moderate: The least expensive item is a $9.50 set of paper clips, the highest a $620 winter coat.\n\nSee also: 10 Etsy Shops for Covetable Fashion Accessories\n\nZady was cofounded by Soraya Darabi, a cofounder of mobile app Foodspotting, and Maxine B\u00e9dat, a lawyer and cofounder of The Bootstrap Project, a small non-profit that sells handmade goods on behalf of artisans in such far-flung locales as Kenya and Tajikistan. The pair attended high school in Minneapolis and reconnected on a trip home two years ago, not long after Darabi had left Footspotting and B\u00e9dat had graduated from Columbia Law School. Both came from families with foreign-born parents and long had interests in cultures with distinct products and supply chains, they said.\n\nFor now, Zady requires that its brands -- about 35 to start -- manufacture their goods in countries with safe labor laws, trusting the \"laws to do the legwork\" until the company can afford to examine the manufacturing facilities of brands they carry directly, B\u00e9dat told Mashable. Each product page contains a series of badges that identify products that are handmade or made from locally sourced materials. Often -- as in the case of denim label Imogene + Willie, whose designers are pictured above -- product pages will contain stories and photographs that offer deeper insight into the history and creation of the garments.\n\nTo date, the eco/ethical fashion movement has remained relatively niche, with startups like Everlane and Of a Kind offering a small (\"curated\") selection of high quality goods, often manufactured locally. Like Zady, both sites have invested in developing stories around the products they offer, emphasizing craftsmanship and authentic design.\n\nZady will also remain modest to start, with buys as small as 10 to 15 units and as large as 150, B\u00e9dat said. Their core customers are urban men and women in their 20s and 30s, but she and Darabi believe the market is \"truly huge\" and that there will soon be the equivalent of a Whole Foods or Trader Joe's for apparel. Other markets, particularly Australia, France, England and Japan, are also ripe for this kind of retail experience, they said.\n\n\"Times are changing,\" Darabi said. \"Even Walmart now carries organic foods.\"\n\nImages: Zady"},"shares":{"twitter":689,"linked_in":30,"facebook":64,"google_plus":3,"pinterest":2,"total":788},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3LzJkL2ltb2dlbmV3aWxsLjhlZGRkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/1ee66abd/d55/imogene+willie-thumb.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI3LzJkL2ltb2dlbmV3aWxsLjhlZGRkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/10c31522/d55/imogene+willie-thumb.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/15t7xKX","choice":false,"shortcode_data":{"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"see_also":[{"data-slug":"etsy-shops-fashion"}]},"excerpt":"For every action there is a reaction.

He encourages the staff of his online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods to show off their skills -- from hula-hooping to jewelry-making -- at company talent shows and in classes for employees. And he once lured an engineer to move from the West Coast with a conversation about Brooklyn's hip-hop legacy.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Russell Hancock is skeptical about how a failed actress is going to help build a business. He's the CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a think tank, and he's also a concert pianist who has performed with orchestras on national tours.\n\n\"I've found that there are ways that I'm creative on the stage and with a musical instrument that don't necessarily translate to my professional life,\" Hancock said. \"It's apples and oranges.\"\n\nAlso, it's not like Silicon Valley lacks an arts community, Hancock said.

Yahoo had 6.8 billion visits, including 700 million for Tumblr and 100 million for Flickr. In the United States, Google had 9.4 billion visits, which is more than Yahoo had worldwide. Yahoo's U.S. visits totaled 2.4 billion. (While SimilarWeb's figures included Tumblr, comScore's did not.)\n\nThe figures come after comScore's July data showed Yahoo had 196.6 million unique visitors in the U.S. that month, compared to 192.3 million for Yahoo. \n\nOf course, visits and visitors are completely different metrics. A visitor can make several visits per month, as SimilarWeb's stats show. However, the statistic is not the same as pageviews, which would inventory every web site viewed during the period. \n\nDaniel Buchuk, head of brand and strategy at SimilarWeb, says he thinks visits are a more accurate portrait of consumer Internet use. \"[comScore]'s not really counting if a person goes to YouTube once a month or 300 times a month,\" he says.\n\nSimilarWeb, a unit of the Tel Aviv-based SimilarGroup, bases its figures on data compiled from consumer-facing browser plug-ins. SimilarGroup, which received $2.5 million in funding in January to bolster SimilarWeb, sees its web measurement tool as a rival to Alexa. \n\nImage: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/GettyImages"},"shares":{"twitter":793,"facebook":189,"linked_in":127,"google_plus":188,"stumble_upon":787,"pinterest":4,"total":2088},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI2LzViL0dvb2dsZVN0YXRpLmRkODY5LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/b003abc0/70a/Google-Statistics-up-from-Yahoo.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzI2LzViL0dvb2dsZVN0YXRpLmRkODY5LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/b41ac46d/70a/Google-Statistics-up-from-Yahoo.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1feevoJ","choice":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"google-autocomplete-questions"}]},"excerpt":"Not so fast, Yahoo.

The company initially raised $16 billion from its IPO, valuing it at just more than $104 billion. However, its market cap declined rapidly in the following months. \n\nThe stock hit a low of $17.55 in early September on lingering concerns about its ability to transition to mobile and some notable Facebook insiders selling off stock. As a result, Facebook's market cap dropped below $50 billion. \n\nIn recent weeks, the stock has enjoyed a nice surge following an impressive June quarter earnings report, which revealed that mobile ads now account for 41% of the company's total ad revenue. That helped send Facebook's stock back above its IPO price of $38 a share for the first time. Facebook stock closed above $40 a share on Friday for the first time and is now approaching its all-time high of $45 a share, which it hit briefly on the day of the IPO. \n\nBy comparison, Google has a market cap of just under $300 billion, while  LinkedIn has a market cap of about $32 billion.
