					<p><font size="4" color="#003366" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Founded by Walter C. Baker, (1868-1955) with Rollin White president, Fred White treasurer, and the Dorn brothers, Philip and Fredrick. Baker was one of the top motor vehicle innovators of the early era. Although best known for the electric cars that bear his name, and his early land speed records, Baker came up with technologies and manufacturing processes that helped make all cars practical, such as modern ball bearings, steering knuckles, the fully floating rear axle with worm-gear shaft-drive (patented 1901), and vanadium alloy steel. Baker was with the Cleveland Screw Machine Co (a White Sewing Machine spin off) before starting the American Ball Bearing Co and the Baker Motor Vehicle Co in Cleveland. Walter Baker was also involved (from 1900) with the Peerless Motor car Co. Baker bought Justus B Entz's patent for an electromagnetic starter/drive system from White in 1912, and licensed the rights to the R M Owen Co in 1913. This became the Owen Magnetic.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#003366" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1897 Baker, with Fred Dorn, built his first electric, at Cleveland Screw. He was not working in a vacuum; Sperry was working on his cars there, and his friend C. E. Woods probably offered advice.<br>

Chain drive to the rear axle, two speeds forward, one in reverse, and an advertised range of twenty miles. Edison bought the second one made.<br>
							1902: A Stanhope was offered as a town runabout.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#003366" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Baker builds his race cars. The 3,000 lb, $10,000, tandem seat, Torpedo (sling seats with seat belts) with a 12 HP Elwell-Parker motor, and the 750 lb, single seat, Torpedo Kid. On Memorial Day (May 31) Baker drove the Torpedo, with C. E. Denzer in the second seat switching the battery connections as the car gained speed, in a speed test on Staten Island. The Torpedo went over 80 mph. Unfortunately a wheel caught a streetcar track and collapsed causing the car to hit spectators resulting in two fatalities and several injuries. Due to the bad press the car was not raced in public afterwards, but was said to have run as fast as 120 MPH.<br>

							1910: Four Models from $2,000-$2,600. The voltage was increased from 48 to 56. Baker claims sales of 1,000 cars. On August 30 1910 they ran a car for 201.6 miles on a single charge with a lead battery, later in the year they achieve 244-1/2 miles with an Edison battery. It is likely that at the end of the run the lead battery was scrap and the Edison battery was nearly normal.<br>

EVC continued to make electrics under the Columbia brand till 1907. After 1907 the brand continued as gasoline cars. The EVC cars and commercial vehicles were marketed as either Columbia or (briefly) Riker, utilizing the designs and patents of Maxim, Riker, Morris &amp; Salom, and Selden for electric and explosion motorcars. Overcapitalized ($20 million) to the point of guaranteeing failure, the enterprise was liquidated in 1907. The Maxwell-Brisco interests picked up most of the residue. ESB batteries.<br>

					<p><font size="4" color="#003366" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These companies made Detroit Electric cars from 1907 to 1939 in Detroit Michigan. They also made trucks from 1910 to 1916, car bodies on contract till 1919, and ambulance bodies 1916-1919. The last iteration of the Company remained on Michigan corporate records as a dormant company till the late sixties. The most successful manufacturer of electric cars in the twentieth century, with over 12,300 Pleasure cars, and 535 trucks. They manufactured very dependable cars, with quality coachwork featuring curved quarter windows, aluminum body panels and roof.<br>

					<p><font size="4" color="#003366" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Detroit Electric was no leader in innovation. When coachbuilder Rauch &amp; Lang decided on electric propulsion for their luxury carriages in 1905, Anderson followed the next year. When Rauch &amp; Lang purchased (merged with) their main electrical component supplier in 1907 Detroit bought their main supplier (Elwell-Parker) in 1909. After Baker introduced shaft drive in 1906, Detroit introduced it in 1911. Ohio introduced Double Drive cars in 1913, Detroit the Duplex Drive in 1914. After Milburn introduced the &quot;Milburn Light Electric&quot; in late 1914, for thirty percent less money, Detroit introduced their cheaper &quot;Light Chassis&quot; cars in 1917.<br>

					<p><font size="4" color="#003366" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The archetypical Detroit is the classic &quot;Cinderella's Coach&quot; Brougham that dominated sales from 1912 to 1919. They were available in four and five passenger bodies with tiller controls at the rear seat, the front, or both. As early as 1908 the company attempted to appeal to the sporting gentleman with a series of faux radiator cars that resembled the gasoline cars of the time. This was abandoned during the peak sales years between 1914 and 1918 to be revived in 1919 when the company split into three parts and the surviving electric car company had no body factory. The majority of the bodies 1919-1921 were from the HM Body Co in Racine Wisconsin. The Broughams from that time on were old stock from when the factory was going full tilt just two years earlier. The last entirely new car was made mid 1926, and the balance of cars sold as &quot;new&quot; ('til February of 1939) were remanufactured cars with borrowed (Willys, Dodge) bodies.<br>

							<b>Edison</b> Although he left the driving to an employee, or his wife Mina, or his son Charles, Edison owned a lot of electric cars. Starting with an 1897 Columbia Mk III, he then bought the second Baker made (1899), a circa 1907 Studebaker, a Woods, a 1909 Bailey, a 1910 Waverley, in 1911 the Edison Storage Battery Co. got an all blue Detroit Electric Victoria, the family got a very fancy 1911 Rauch &amp; Lang outside drive Brougham, and a 1914 model 47 Detroit Electric Brougham. As usual he thought he could do a better job of it, so he built an electric locomotive for Menlo Park (it ran about 1,500 feet to a fishing hole), announced the production of a &quot;new&quot; light delivery truck in 1910 (Lansden), and contributed to the design of the two Ford electric car prototypes in 1914.<br>

He put much of his time and personal fortune into developing an alkaline secondary battery. It was (eventually) good enough to recover his investment (with the help of a Navy contract in 1915), but not cheap enough or efficient enough to save the battery automobile.<br>

							<b>Electric Carriage and Wagon Co</b>. 1896-1898 Founded by Henry G. Morris and Pedro G. Salom in January 1896, Capitol of $10,000 came from George Herbert Condict, with Electric Storage Battery Co. owners W. W. Gibbs and Isaac L. Rice, to build taxi cabs based on the Electrobat. They had thirteen cabs built by the Charles S. Caffrey Co of Camden NJ. Each had an 800 lb, ESB built, Cloride-Manchester battery, and a pair of 1-1/2 HP Lundell motors. They ran them with some success in New York from March of 1897 with 12 active cabs &amp; drivers, and a staff of six at the charging station. Rice took over on September 27th 1897, he made about 90 more cabs before the &quot;lead cab syndicate&quot; made him a generous offer, see Electric Vehicle Company.<br>

							<b>Electric Vehicle Co.</b> 1899-1907 the new name of the Electric Carriage and Wagon Co. re-formed by financiers (William C. Whitney, P. A. B. Widener, Anthony N. Brady, Thomas F. Ryan, et. al.) to create a taxicab monopoly (first in New York, then in all major cities). They bought the company and merged it with Pope's car division Columbia Motor-Carriage (to make the taxies) in April of 1899 as the Columbia Automobile Company, then in May it was reorganized as the Columbia and Electric Vehicle Company when Pope was bought out in June 1900. The company finally became part of the Whitney led holding company, the Electric Vehicle Company (EVC), of which the most profitable holding was the Electric Storage Battery Co of Philadelphia, as their profit was in battery sales rather then the success of the taxi enterprises. The personal holdings of the financiers were weighed toward ESB stock. They acquired Riker in December 1900 for his patents and manufacturing plant (he quit EVC January 1st 1902). As many as 1,000 cabs were built by various acquired coachworks and contractors, including 100 bodies by Studebaker that were ordered in June 1899. The early design lead battery weighed about a ton and was removed and recharged after every trip. As usual the battery eventually killed the vehicle (with tire and employee problems also significant). The cab company in New York was moderately profitable and lasted till 1912 (with the electric cab fleet diluted by gasoline cabs after 1907, they were gone by 1910). The monopoly scheme was partly based on ESB owning the battery patents of Charles F Brush, A Marchenay (US rights), General Electric, Consolidated Electric Storage, Electric Launch &amp; Navigation, and others (they could refuse batteries to other cab makers). To cover all bases, and to continue production of Maxim's Gas cars, they also acquired the rights to Rochester patent attorney George Selden's &quot;liquid hydrocarbon motor carriage&quot; patent (two-stroke engine) for ten thousand dollars and a promise of future royalties. EVC had more debt then their income could support and did not survive the 1907 bank panic (with the collapse of 73 banks). ESB went their own way, the Selden patent expired in 1912 three years after what was left of the company lost the infringement suit against Ford, as the four-stroke engines they used were judged not in breach. Both the cab business and the monopoly strategies failed, and the investors lost millions of dollars. Eventually the Maxwell-Briscoe Motor Co group of Long Island City, NY acquired the residue.<br>

The first Electrobat was a slow, heavy, impractical vehicle. Morris &amp; Salom went on to build about a dozen Hansom cabs based on the Electrobat before selling the concept and the cabs to Isaac Rice of Electric Storage Battery (see Electric Carriage &amp; Wagon Co).<br>

								Milburn Light Electric </b>1914-1923, The Milburn Wagon Co Toledo Ohio;<br>
							Founded by George Milburn (1820-1883) in 1848. The Milburn Wagon Co was the biggest of the 550 carriage companies in Ohio and one of the most successful wagon and carriage companies in America. By 1914 the horse carriage business was fading fast as the Ford model T came to dominate rural transportation. Much of Milburn's business by then was in making bodies for automobile manufacturers. With the expiration of electric motor and control patents, and with the new industry wide automotive patent sharing agreement, Milburn saw an opportunity to get a share of the electric car market by combining proven technologies with the efficient, highly mechanized, body assembly techniques that kept the company the price point leader in carriages and car bodies. Throughout the electric car days they made more gas car bodies on contract then electric cars. Designed by Karl Probst (later of Bantam Jeep fame), as a much lighter (2,100 lbs), less expensive car. The company came up with their own version of shaft-drive with a very large nickel-steel worm gear driving a relatively small bronze alloy worm wheel. The components were made by other companies (the motor and controller were made by General Electric). The electric car plant had perhaps two acres of floor space and 200 employees. The lower price point made the Milburn popular, and slightly more competitive with the cheaper gas cars. Milburn became the last significant manufacture of electric cars in the pre-WWII era, with 3,000 to 4,300 units. In late 1919 the original factory burned down and manufacture moved to the grounds of the University of Toledo. In February 1923 the company's coach-works (that mostly made Buick bodies by 1921) was purchased by General Motors to build Oldsmobile bodies.<br>

The motto for 1915 was &quot;weighs nearly ton less&quot;, they got heavier. In 1916 Milburn went to an 60 Volt system with a longer chassis and half elliptical springs in front.<br>

							<b>Morrison Electric</b> 1887-1891 Des Moines, IA; William Morrison 1850(?)-1927. Born in Scotland Morrison arrived in Des Moines in 1880 as a chemist. In 1887 he made an unsuccessful attempt to build a car but the center-pivot steering didn't work. He then commissioned a fringe top surrey from the Des Moines Buggy Company, that he electrified in September of 1890, to demonstrate his new battery (patented 1891 With L. Schmidt). It may have been the first land vehicle steered with a wheel, and featured his patented rack and pinion steering gear (Immisch may have done both a year earlier). Watchmaker Dr. Lew Arntz did the mechanical modifications. Powered by 24 of his lead-acid storage cells (48 Volts) with 112 Ampere-hours capacity it weighed two tons. A spur gear on a four horse-power Siemens trolley-car motor, that Morrison rewound to work at a lower voltage more practical for battery application (about 15% of trolley car voltage), this drove a large ring gear on the right rear wheel. This car became very influential when the American Battery Company of Chicago purchased it for $3,600 to demonstrate their commercial version of the Morrison battery at the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition. At the fair almost everyone who would be influential in early motoring history saw the carriage. ABC Secretary Harold Sturges replaced the rear seat with a larger battery, installed a different motor, and entered it in the Chicago race on Thanksgiving Day 1895. Due to five inches of fresh snow on the roads the car had little chance, the motor overheated in the first ten miles. The race version weighed 3,535 lbs. Major George Tyler Burroughs VP of ABC estimated that between Morrison and American Battery more than $20,000 had been invested in the car, all though he felt that production cost would be about $1,000 per car. The car was last seen in Kansas City MO. Morrison further developed batteries at the Vesta Accumulator Co., and in the summer of 1897 Sturges went to the Klondike to search for gold.<br>

							<b>Pope </b>Columbia, Waverley, Pope-Waverly.<br>
							1895-1898 The Pope Manufacturing Co. was the worlds most successful bicycle maker (since 1885) headed by Albert Augustus Pope, with relatives Harry M (super of Hartford Cycle Co), Edward W. &amp; his cousin George. In 1895 VP Harold Hayden Eames hired Hiram Percy Maxim to design motorcars. He had built a three cylinder Otto cycle gas tricycle of his own design. Eames was certain that electric was the way to go and in 1896 had Maxim build two proto-types, the Mk I electric (with the motor on the axle), and Mk II two-stroke gasoline car (a failure). Ten production Columbia Electric Mk III cars were produced by May 1897. They weighed only 1,900 lbs. of which 800 lbs. was the battery, as they were built on carbon steel bicycle tube frames. The Mk III could go 30 miles at 12 mph powered by a two-horse Eddy motor that weighed 120 lbs. This was the first reliable commercially available automobile in North America, and for Col. Pope confirmed his belief that electric propulsion was the future of personal transportation. In early 1900 the company was taken over by the Electric Vehicle Co. as part of a scheme to create an electric cab monopoly. Pope was not the junior partner type and in June 1900 sold his interest in the cab conspiracy to EVC. He took the cash, and his bicycle companies, to form a conglomerate of some forty bicycle makers under the name American Bicycle Company, he also bought steam truck builder Lozier, and Waverly Electric. Pope's new empire was liquidated in 1907. Albert Pope died in August 1909. The Columbia brand continued as a gasoline car under various owners until 1912, Waverly continued making electrics under new owners until 1916. </font></p>

							1920-1930 Rauch &amp; Lang Co. a subsidiary of Stevens-Duryea<br>
							1920-1945 Baker-Raulang Co, Bodies &amp; material handlers.<br>
							The Rauch family had been a builder of wagons, then luxury carriages, in Cleveland since 1853. Founder Jacob Rauch was killed in the Civel War at Gettysburg, his son Charles Rauch teamed up with accountant Charles E. J. Lang, whose family made a fortune in the Cleveland real estate boom, to build the business into the principal maker of wagons and carriages in the region. In 1904 they decided to make luxury electric carriages. The motor and controller were from the Hertner Electric Co, which became part of R &amp; L in 1907. In June of 1915, in part to settle infringements on Baker patents, R &amp; L with a capitalization value of $1 million, merged with Baker, at a capitol value of $1.25 million, Owen Magnetic was folded into the mix along with fresh capitol from General Electric. The new company was called Baker Rauch &amp; Lang, some of the Lang interests diverged as the Lang Body Co. In the winter of 1919-1920 the Company changed its name to Baker-Raulang with a body division and a material handling division (eventually absorbed by Otis Elevator). The automobile division was sold to Stevens-Duryea of Chicopee Falls Mass, they opened a subsidiary called Rauch &amp; Lang Inc, which made electric cabs.<br>

							1899-1900; Riker Electric Vehicle Co. Elizabethport, NJ<br>
							1901-1902; Electric Vehicle Co, New York.<br>
							Andrew Lawrence Riker; (October 22nd 1868 to June 1st 1930). In 1884-86 Riker made his first electric, a modified Coventry bicycle, with a large outrigger wheel driven by a 1/6 hp motor of his own manufacture. It was said to go 8 mph.<br>
							Riker set up business in 1888 making electric motors based on his patents, including his slotted armature and laminated field core designs. Between 1888 and 1890 he rigged two Remington bicycles together to create his four wheeled &quot;motor cycle&quot;, it weighed 315 lbs. His company made a full range of electric vehicles from 1895-1902, from a light two-seat tricycle up to a five-ton truck. In 1896 he raced one of his production cars running up to 27 mph. Riker got faster. On November 16, 1901 at Coney Island NY the 1,850 lb Riker racer, with a 60-cell battery under a platform with no body, went a mile in 60.3 seconds (59.97 mph). The two motor Riker cars were made with a motor driving each rear wheel by means of a spur gear on the motor driving a ring gear on the wheel. While this is simple, efficient, and avoids the need for a differential, it means that the motors must be mounted in rigid alignment to the wheel. This creates a lot of un-sprung weight, a liability on all but the smoothest roads. The gears were exposed to abrasive dust and pebbles that would gum up the works, affecting longevity and reliability. The Electric Vehicle Company purchased Riker for stock in December 1900 for Riker's patents. The Elizabethport plant was closed late in 1901. Riker, distracted by steam and explosion engines, and not a team player, left EVC January 1st 1902 to design cars for Locomobile. The Riker brand was used for Locomobile trucks in the late teens.<br>
