<p>Gotham Dream Cars is pleased to offer its premier exotic car rental and luxury car rental fleet to the New York tri-state area and beyond.  Vehicles are available for pick-up from our office in Englewood NJ (just 5 minutes over the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey) or available for door-to-door delivery throughout the region.  Delivery is available to all locations in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and beyond.</p>

<p>Our goal is twofold: To offer exotic car rentals that can't be found anywhere else; and to offer a level of service that far surpasses what clients in the northeast have come to expect from a traditional "car rental" company. We recognize that exotic cars are only half the rental equation -- without high-end service, particularly in a place like New York City, clients are not getting their money's worth.  Gotham Dream Cars aims to offer the same level of service for clients renting a supercar that they would expect when buying a supercar.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Guys! Thanks to everybody at Gotham Dream Cars for making this unbelievable weekend a reality. Everything from the service of the Gotham team to the performance of the car was absolutely spectacular.

Keep up the exceptional work and please thank everyone again for me.&quot;

<h3>Rental Policies</h3>
<h4>Requirements / Age Limit</h4>
<p>Vehicles are available to drivers over the age of 21 with clean driving records (no major moving violations, DUI convictions, or similar infractions).  Unfortunately, we cannot rent any vehicles to drivers under the age of 21.</p>
<p>All renters must be physically present at the start of the rental.  Unfortunately we do not allow 3rd parties to pick up vehicles and our employees must physically hand the keys over to the person who will be driving.</p>
<h4>Insurance</h4>
<p>All renters must carry some form of insurance to cover damages to the vehicle in the event of an accident. You've got several options:</p>
<p>The easiest option is if you carry an insurance policy on a personal vehicle that you own or lease. We will verify with your insurer that your policy is active.</p>
<p>Customers from NY are required to maintain only liability insurance.</p>
<p>Customers from any other state are required to maintain full-coverage insurance (liability, comprehensive, and collision).</p>
<p>The good news is that it does not matter what you drive personally - as long as you have insurance in good standing, your carrier will cover damages to our cars (think of it as if you were driving down the road and caused an accident with a guy in a Ferrari -- your insurance will cover the damages even if you're driving a VW).</p>
<p>Another options is if you have an American Express card - they offer a program called 'Premium Car Rental Protection'. This is available <a href="https://www295.americanexpress.com/premium/car-rental-insurance-coverage/home.do" target="_new">directly from American Express</a> and provides coverage for your GDC rental vehicle. This is a great option because it can be purchased in addition to your regular insurance policy and provides an extra layer of protection.</p>
<p>If neither of the above apply, there are some 3rd-party companies that provide damage waiver products. Please inquire for details on these options.</p>
<h4>International Renters</h4>
<p>Vehicles are available to international visitors with a valid passport and driver's license from their home country. We can arrange for insurance coverage for those international visitors renting for a minimum of two days.  Please note that international renters who do not have their own insurance coverage will be subject to a higher security deposit ($5k - $15k, depending on vehicle).</p>
<h4>MVR</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to run an MVR (Motor Vehicle Record) report on all renters prior to the start of the rental in order to verify a valid Driver's License.</p>
<h4>Additional Drivers</h4>
<p>Additional drivers may be listed on your Rental Agreement at no additional charge.  Each additional driver must be present at the time of delivery, must submit a driver's license in advance, and will be subject to the same age, licensing and driving-record restrictions as the primary renter.</p>
<h4>Delivery / Pick-up</h4>
<p>You may choose to pick up / return your vehicle to our office or have it delivered directly to your home, office, hotel, airport, or other location.  We provide storage of your vehicle at our locations at no charge.  Door-to-door delivery is available for a small additional fee depending on the distance traveled.</p>
<p>Please note: All pick-up & delivery arrangements must be confirmed at least 24 hours in advance in order to guarantee on-time service. Any changes to pick-up or delivery times/locations with less than 24 hours notice may incur an additional transportation fee.</p>
<p>(In other words: we will do our absolute best to get you the vehicle when and where you want it, however if you change your mind after we've scheduled our guys, we may charge you for it).</p>
<h4>Return Times</h4>
<p>We are very flexible about vehicle return times - i.e. we're not sticklers about a 2 day rental being exactly 48 hours. But once we have made a return appointment, we need to stick to it. There will be a 1-hour grace period with your scheduled return time, after which you may be subject to additional daily rental fees.</p>
<p>(Our dedicated delivery team works very hard and very long hours 7 days a week, and if one of them is waiting around for 2, 3, or 4+ hours because of a missed return appointment, it throws off the entire schedule.)</p>
<h4>Damage Deposit</h4>
<p>All renters must leave a damage deposit in the form of a credit card authorization, cashier's check, or cash. Any damage found on the vehicle upon return will be billed against this deposit. The amount of this deposit will vary depending on the vehicle being rented and your type of insurance, but typically varies between $2500 - $15k.</p>
<p>This deposit is fully refundable following the completion of the rental. If you are using an American Express card for the deposit, it is run as an "authorization only" (no actual charge). If you are using a Visa, Mastercard or Discover card, this deposit is run as a charge which is then reversed following the completion of the rental.</p>
<h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
<p>When you make a reservation, we may authorize your credit card immediately for up to the full cost of the rental, though you will not be charged until you physically take possession of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Because we have a limited supply of vehicles to offer, we pack the schedule very tightly. We offer a 24-hour grace period after you make your reservation to make changes or cancel (unless the rental is within 7 days), after which there will be a cancellation fee of 50% of the total rental cost or $500 (whichever is greater).</p>
<p>If you cancel or reschedule less than 7 days before your rental (or are a no-show at the time of rental), you will be charged a cancellation fee of 100% of the total rental cost.</p>
<p>Reservations made for the Dream Car Tour and Dream Car Sprint are non-refundable regardless of booking time, however they are fully transferable, so we gladly allow you to designate a replacement driver if you cannot make it.</p>
<p>Please understand that there are no exceptions to this cancellation policy. We don't mean to sound heartless, but you would be amazed at the number of last-minute deaths in the family, serious illnesses, sick pets, sick mother-in-laws, rabid dogs, and falling skies that people tell us about. (One guy's father has died three times in the past year. Bad karma.)</p>
<h4>Weather Policy</h4>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot control the weather (as much as we have tried - but that darn Vulcan Weather Satellite just doesn't work like it used to). That means, as per the cancellation policy above, we cannot offer refunds or rescheduling if the skies decide not to play nice.</p>
<p>However, if there is a weather condition on a particular day that might make driving dangerous (i.e. snow, ice, hurricane, tornado, alien attack, etc.) and you do not actually use your vehicle on that day, we may (at our discretion) offer you an extension on your rental or credit on a future rental.</p>
<p>For example, if you rent a car Fri - Sun, it snows on Sun, and the car remains parked in your garage, you may be able to extend your rental through Monday for no additional charge. If you've got a question about this policy, just give us a call and we'll work with you.</p>
<h4>Payment Methods</h4>
<p>VISA, Mastercard, American Express and Discover are the preferred method of payment for rental fees and damage deposits. In certain cases, cashier's checks or cash may be accepted if pre-arranged. Personal & business checks are not accepted because of the absolutely massive and absurd amount of fraud that seems to come with them.</p>
<h4>Fuel, Toll & MVR Surcharge</h4>
<p>An EZ-Pass (in the Northeast) or SunPass (in Florida) is included in each vehicle, so you can zip through tolls and focus on driving (and having fun!) without worrying about fumbling for change.</p>
<p>Vehicles are delivered to you with a full tank of gas and can be returned full, empty, or anywhere in between.</p>
<p>However, when you do gas up, all vehicles must be refueled with Premium grade (93+ octane) gasoline. There is a $350 fee for filling up with a lesser grade. And yes, we'll know.</p>
<p>There is a $85 fee per rental (regardless of duration) to cover the costs of fuel, tolls, and the procurement of an MVR report (to verify your spotless, perfect driving record.)</p>
<h4>Refunds</h4>
<p>We do not offer refunds for vehicle rentals or gift certificates. However, our goal is total satisfaction for our renters, so in certain situations we may offer credit for additional rental days (i.e. weather, see above). This is solely at our discretion.</p>
<p>In the event of an unforeseen mechanical failure during or prior to a rental, we will make every effort to repair or replace your vehicle with a similar or better model at no additional cost to you.</p>
<h4>Discounts</h4>
<p>Discounts and special incentives cannot be combined or 'stacked' unless explicitly indicated. Pick the bigger one and enjoy!</p>
<h4>Driving Area</h4>
<p>Vehicles rented from our NY/Northeast office may not be driven outside the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Washington D.C, Virginia, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, or New Hampshire without prior written approval.</p>
<p>Vehicles rented from our South Florida office may not be driven outside the state of Florida without prior written approval.</p>
<p>Vehicles rented from our Los Angeles office may not be driven outside the state of California without prior written approval.</p>
<h4>Prohibited Uses</h4>
<p>Our wonderful rental vehicles may not be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>by anyone not licensed to drive or whose Driver's License has been suspended or restricted</li>
<li>for any illegal purpose or in connection with any illegal activity</li>
<li>to carry persons or property for hire</li>
<li>to push or tow anything (you wouldn't, would you?)</li>
<li>to exceed any posted speed limits</li>
<li>in any speed test, speed contest, race, rally, speed endurance contest, demonstration, or on or near any racetrack or road course (we're serious about this -- no insurance company on earth will cover the car while on the track, and that means we're both on the hook for a LOT of money)</li>
<li>to teach anyone to drive</li>
<li>on any unpaved surface</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of a violation of these Prohibited Uses, we reserve the right to end your rental and retrieve the vehicle.</p>
<h4>Tickets</h4>
<p>The renter is responsible for all parking, traffic, speeding or other tickets or violations issued while the vehicle is being rented and must pay for any fees, penalties, towing charges, or impound costs.</p>
<h4>Mileage</h4>
<p>Daily and weekend rentals include 100 miles free per day and weekly rentals include 700 miles free, unless stated otherwise. Each additional mile driven will be subject to a charge at the stated mileage rate.</p>
<p>Vehicles driven more than double the allotted rental mileage will be subject to an additional surcharge to cover excess wear-and-tear.</p>

<div class='faq'>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4>Can I get the car delivered at 8am or 11pm?</h4>
<p>Possibly. Our normal delivery hours are between 10am and 6pm. Any deliveries outside of those hours will incur a surcharge of $100 and up.  Give us a shout - we'll do our best to work around your schedule.</p>
<h4>Why is there a 2 hour delivery window?</h4>
<p>We have 2 hour window for deliveries because unfortunately we cannot control traffic, flat tires, etc. and we've learned to leave more time rather than less.  We always aim to get there at the beginning of your delivery window, so we'll do our best.</p>
<h4>Do you offer hourly rentals?</h4>
<p>Alas, we do not.  We've run the numbers and the prep / delivery / pick-up overhead is too high to be worthwhile for either of us.</p>
<h4>But I only need the car for an hour.</h4>
<p>We understand that many of our clients only have a need for a vehicle for a time period of less than a day, however by renting it to you for even 10 minutes, we are eliminating the possibility that we can rent the car to another customer. So in essence, we are giving up the car for the full day regardless of how long you use it for.  As such, we must charge for a full day.</p>
<h4>Ok, then I only want it for one day on the weekend.  Can I do that?</h4>
<p>Sorry to have to say 'no' again.  Because of the huge demand we get for weekend rentals, we aren't able to offer a guaranteed one-day rental on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday in advance.  Similar to the above, if we guarantee it to you for just a day, we're giving up the chance to rent it for 2 days, which is what most folks want on the weekends and what we need to do to make business sense.</p>
<p>If you really, really need that car for your wedding/anniversary/surprise gift, and it's gotta be on the weekend, the only way to guarantee it 100% is to book for a full weekend (Friday-Sunday, 48 hours).</p>
<p>There is one exception though:  We do offer “non-guaranteed” (i.e. stand-by) one-day rentals on weekends on a walk-in basis only.  So if you give us a call on Saturday morning and the car you want is still available, we'll gladly rent it to you same-day for just that day.</p>
<h4>My {insert relative here} just died. Can I cancel? Please, have a heart.</h4>
<p>Ok, we're really, really trying not to be heartless here, but know this: When someone calls to cancel a rental, there's an 80% chance that they use the death-in-the-family excuse with us. (yes, we've measured.) We've heard it so much, that A) we can't believe that so many people would stoop so low, and B) We don't believe it anymore. We're very sorry if you actually have a death in the family, because there are a lot of people out there who cry wolf and have ruined it for you and made us cold, heartless automitons.</p>
<h4>Does my own insurance cover the rental of a Ferrari? I only drive a Toyota Camry!</h4>
<p>Believe it or not, the answer is yes. In all 50 states, if you carry full-coverage insurance (that means Liability, Comp, and Collision) your insurance will automatically carry over and cover you when you rent a car from us – regardless of what you drive or what you rent. And it's for the same reason that if you're driving down the highway in your Camry and you happen to knock a Ferrari off the road, your insurance will cover the damage.</p>
<h4>I want to rent for my prom. I'm under 21, but my uncle/father/mother/sister/cat is going to rent it for me. I promise I won't be driving the Ferrari. Is that OK?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we've had bad experiences in the past with underage drivers getting their hands on our exotics after their relative rented the vehicle to 'drive them' to prom. So we don't do any prom rentals, full stop. However, if you're a parent and want to arrange to rent one of our luxury sedans to be 'chauffeur' for the night, we're happy to accommodate - just make sure that YOU make the call!</p>
<h4>How many miles do I get with my rental?</h4>
<p>All our rentals include 100 miles per rental day. After that, mileage rates differ depending on the vehicle - check out the car information pages for specifics. If you more than double your included mileage on a rental, there is an additional $3/mile surcharge on top of the standard mileage rate.</p>
<p>For example: You rent the Lamborghini Gallardo for one day. The first 100 miles you drive are included in the price of the rental. 100-200 miles costs you $1.95/mile. Anything over 200 miles costs you $4.95/mile. All mileage charges are billed out of your security deposit.</p>
<h4>Why do I have to leave a security deposit?</h4>
<p>Due to the extremely high cost of the vehicles we offer, it is our policy to take a refundable security deposit for all our rentals and Dream Car Tour participants. The deposits range from $2,500 - $15,000 depending on the vehicle and level of insurance you carry. Rest assured, this is refunded in full once the vehicle has been returned to us and thoroughly inspected. This usually takes 3-5 business days after the end of your rental. If there are any additional mileage charges or minor damages, they are billed from your deposit and the balance is refunded back onto your credit card.</p>
<h4>But I have insurance. Why would you bill me for damage?</h4>
<p>We come across a lot of minor scuffs and scrapes on our cars when they go out on rentals - sometimes customers scrape a wheel, scratch a front bumper or bubble a tire (to name but three). These repairs are quick and relatively inexpensive to make and are billed from the security deposit in order to minimize the amount of time the car is off the road. Once your invoice has been settled, you can of course make a claim to your insurance company to be reimbursed for any charges.</p>
<h4>If I pay cash, do I still have to pay sales tax?</h4>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h4>How much tax do I have to pay?</h4>
<p>The tax rate depends on which state you receive delivery of the vehicle. (Insider tip: For NY/NJ renters, pick up at our NJ location to save big. The tax rate for rental cars in NJ is 7% compared to almost 20% in New York City. We are only 5 minutes over the George Washington Bridge.)</p>
