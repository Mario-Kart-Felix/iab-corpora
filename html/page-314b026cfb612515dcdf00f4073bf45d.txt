			<p><b><i>&ldquo;The Beast&rdquo;</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
			<p><b><i>1969 Pontiac Bonneville Station Wagon</i></b><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p><i>&ldquo;The Beast&rdquo; was assembled in January 1969 at the GM plant in South Gate, Ca.&nbsp; It was then transported to, and sold at Jack Barnes Pontiac in Oxnard, Ca.</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p><i>Only 7428 Bonneville Station Wagons were made in 1969.</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p><i>This Bonneville was very well equipped from the factory, and included the big 428 engine, two-way tailgate, power tailgate window, air conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering, Turbohydromatic 400 automatic transmission, power steering, power disc brakes, AM-FM Stereo, vinyl &ldquo;Cordova&rdquo; top, cornering lights, tinted glass, roof rack, and more!&nbsp; <br>The MSRP was $5949.80&#x2026; a very expensive car in 1969!</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p><i>When I acquired &ldquo;The Beast&rdquo; in August of 2006, it had been sitting in the desert north of Lancaster, about a mile from Willow Springs Raceway. It belonged to one of my customers who was going to pull the engine to use in a basket-case Firebird that he was going to build.&nbsp; Since full quarter panels weren&rsquo;t yet available for the Firebird, those plans were delayed.&nbsp; Meanwhile I expressed my interest in the wagon and I knew that pulling the engine would mean the end for this very original car.&nbsp; Eventually, he sold the Firebird as-is, and traded &ldquo;the Beast&rdquo; to me in exchange for parts for his 1955 Chevy Pickup.&nbsp; The last registration stickers were dated January of 1982!!</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p><i>&ldquo;The Beast&rdquo; is powered by it&rsquo;s original 428 cu. In. engine.&nbsp; After installing a new set of points, it fired right up!&nbsp; I had all the fluids, belts, hoses, brakes, etc. changed, an HEI ignition installed, and various other maintenance items attended to.&nbsp; Then the new exhaust and 20&rdquo; rims were installed.</i></p>
			<p><i>I ordered and received the info package on this car from the Pontiac Historic Services, and I also found an original build sheet!</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p><i>I&rsquo;ve been driving the car and slowly working out the &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;.&nbsp; I have been gathering parts and have just sent the car to get the bodywork and paint done.&nbsp; I have a fiberglass &ldquo;nose&rdquo; to replace the original urethane one. I&rsquo;m going to remove the roof rack for a cleaner look.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to have it painted in the original Champagne color.&nbsp; I may even reinstall a vinyl top, (but probably in black, rather than the original green one) just because it&rsquo;s so unusual to see one on a wagon!</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p><i>I&rsquo;m going to continue to drive and enjoy &ldquo;the Beast&rdquo;, taking it to cruise nights and car shows, and using it to promote my classic car parts business.&nbsp;<br> It feels good to have resurrected &ldquo;the Beast&rdquo;!</i></p>
