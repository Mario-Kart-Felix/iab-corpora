<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This analysis examines the hybrid automobile market and industry by  taking a detailed look at the market, trends, competition, and a SWOT  analysis. We will examine hybrid electric vehicles which typically  combine the internal combustion engine of a conventional vehicle with  the battery and electric motor of an electric vehicle. For purposes of  our research, further attention is given to Toyota, a leader in the  hybrid industry, in order to provide a standard for the industry and a  benchmark for comparison and expectation of trends.</p>
<h2 id="TheMarket">The Market</h2>
<p>The target market, or part of the qualified available market pursued,  for Hybrid automobiles can be identified by examining the major  demographic, psychogenic, geographic, and behavioral segmentation  variables.</p>
<h3 id="DemographicSegmentation">Demographic Segmentation</h3>
<p>The hybrid automobile target market is divided into various demographic  groups including age, life-cycle stage, gender, generation, and social  class.  The consumer is between 30 and 50 years old and of no specific  ethnicity, religious background, or gender (hybridcars.com, n.d.).  They  are affluent, well-informed, and educated adults classed in the  socio-economic segment. They are commonly in higher managerial,  administrative or professional occupations and of upper middle class.  Additionally, they are likely to be married with family  responsibilities. Therefore, they are not only driven to purchase  environmentally-friendly vehicles but also able to pay a higher price  due to their larger amount of disposable income.</p>
<h3 id="PsychographicSegmentation">Psychographic Segmentation</h3>
<p>Within the identified demographic, two different groups, innovators and  thinkers, were identified based on their varying personality traits,  lifestyle, and values.  Innovators are successful, sophisticated, and  active with high self-esteem.  Their purchases often reflect cultivated  tastes for relatively upscale, niche-oriented products and services.  Thinkers are more mature, satisfied, and reflective group of people who  are motivated by ideals, knowledge, and responsibility.  Thinkers  recognize the environmental impact of motoring and would like to do  something about it.  They are seeking to express their concern and ease  their conscience.  The two identified psychographic groups for the  hybrid automobile market were identified to have higher economic  resources.</p>
<h3 id="GeographicSegmentation">Geographic Segmentation</h3>
<p>High portions of the target market for hybrid automobiles are in urban  areas with populations that desire to buy a car with environmentally  friendly features (hybridcars.com, n.d.). This can be attributed to the  problems of pollution and congestion being more widely perceived as a  serious issue in larger cities.</p>
<h3 id="BehavioralSegmentation">Behavioral Segmentation</h3>
<p>Behavioral variables including benefits, usage rate, and attitude have  been identified as starting points for constructing market segments for  hybrid automobiles. Buyers can be classified according to the benefits  they seek. Hybrid vehicle consumers anticipate fuel prices to rise more  quickly than do non-hybrid consumers, therefore they expect a return on  their investment as fuel prices increase.  Hybrid consumers also drive  fewer miles on average and keep their automobile longer than the average  person, often more than five years (hybridcars.com, n.d.).  Finally,  they are willing to pay more for an environmentally friendly product and  want to do something to help reduce vehicle pollution.</p>
<h3 id="QuantitativeAnalysis">Quantitative Analysis</h3>
<p>The hybrid automobile market can be described as being in the  introduction or developmental stage of the product life cycle.  The  current market for hybrid vehicles is small, consisting of only 1.6% of  all new light vehicles for the month January 2007.  However, as Figure  1, Hybrid Percentage of Total US Light Duty Vehicle Sales, indicates the  market has been steadily increasing in recent years and the expectation  is that the market is anticipated to grow.  In January 2007, hybrid  sales increased 11% to 17,591 (Green Car Congress, 2007).</p>
<p>The future in this market looks especially bright for Toyota.  They are  already a major player in the automobile industry and more specifically,  hybrid sales.  Toyota’s sales for 2006 topped 2,542,524 making the  company the third largest automobile manufacturer in the United States.   Even more impressive is that Toyota sales increased 12.9% while GM and  Ford, the top two sellers, showed a decrease of 8.7% and 8% respectively  (Puskar, 2007).  Refocusing on Toyota in the hybrid market; Toyota  hybrids made up 80% of all hybrid sales for January 2007 which follows a  33% increase in hybrid sales over 2006, Toyota’s continued dominance in  the hybrid market in depicted in Figure 2.  While the hybrid market  appears to be steadily increasing, Toyota is setting extremely high  goals for itself.  They are looking to increase global hybrid sales by  40% in 2007 to 430,000 units.  To allow for such growth, the company has  increased production of the Prius, the most popular of their hybrid  line, by 40% to 280,000 vehicles (Reuters, 2007).</p>
<h3 id="UnmetNeeds">Unmet Needs</h3>
<p>The automobile industry has been around over a century and it was  developed to meet the simple consumer need of transportation.   Additional aspects of the consumer buying decision include safety,  reliability, value, luxury, and esteem.  All of these needs can be met  be any number of conventional vehicles.  However, the introduction of  hybrid vehicles allowed poorly served needs of fuel efficiency and  environmental benefit to be addressed. Conventional vehicles release  harmful chemicals, or pollutants, as exhaust. These chemicals, such as  oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, particulates, carbon  monoxide, and carbon dioxide, are produced through the combustion of  fossil fuels. In addition to causing &#8220;smog,&#8221; and possibly contributing  to global warming, these chemicals have been determined to cause or  aggravate human respiratory diseases, including bronchitis, emphysema,  pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma (US Department of Energy).</p>
<p>Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) typically combine the internal  combustion engine of a conventional vehicle with the battery and  electric motor of an electric vehicle. The combination offers low  emissions, with the power, range, and convenient fueling of conventional  (gasoline and diesel) vehicles. The inherent flexibility of HEVs makes  them well suited for fleet and personal transportation. Hybrid electric  vehicles have the potential to be two to three times more fuel-efficient  than conventional vehicles. The introduction of hybrid vehicles, with  their increased fuel economy and reduced use of fossil fuels, emit fewer  of these pollutants into the air we breathe and fill some of the unmet  needs of consumers.</p>
<h3 id="Trends">Trends</h3>
<p>A trend is a direction or sequence of events that has some momentum and  durability. Trends are more predictable and durable than fads and they  reveal a shape of the future. The hybrid automobile market has relevant  trends in each of the six macro trend categories- demographic, economic,  natural, technological, and social-cultural- that support and detract  from the demand for the hybrid vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="DemographicTrends">Demographic Trends</h3>
<p>Recent population trends are showing a geographical population shift  toward warmer climates and coastal regions throughout the United States  (US Census Bureau).  As these areas, such as California, continue to  experience high population growth, environmental issues resulting from  urban congestion may increase the demand for hybrid technology.</p>
<p>Data on the national population age and ethnic mix indicates an increase  in minority groups throughout the country.  This represents a potential  growing market for hybrid vehicles. Additionally, the United State’s  population will continue to age over the next twenty years resulting in  an increase of the 45 to 85 year olds (US Census Bureau).  Because  neither ethnic minorities nor the elderly are currently part of the  target market for hybrid vehicles, they must become appealing to these  groups in order to maintain an increase in demand.</p>
<h3 id="EconomicTrends">Economic Trends</h3>
<p>According to a recent study, an income gap is developing between  high-income and low- or middle-income families throughout the United  States.  Despite the tremendous overall economic growth of the 1980s and  1990s and the low unemployment rates of the late 1990’s, the income gap  is widening (Economic Policy Institute).  This data indicates a  potential increase in demand for hybrid automobiles because of the  increasing number of high-income families. However, it also suggests a  growing number of lower-income families that would not be able to afford  the current costs of hybrid vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="NaturalTrends">Natural Trends</h3>
<p>As increased dependence on non-renewable energy sources continues to  force up gasoline prices, a general target market shift is expected from  the environmentally concerned to a consumer who is seeking a method to  reduce their fuel expense.  No longer will the hybrid consumer only be  those who purchase the hybrid vehicle based on ideological concerns such  as foreign demand on oil or global warming.  As fuel prices continue to  increase per gallon, the hybrid market will become more appealing to  the general population.</p>
<h3 id="TechnologicalTrends">Technological Trends</h3>
<p>The future of the hybrid automobile market rests in the increased  availability of hybrid models, including SUVs and pick-up trucks.  Once  the hybrid technology has matured, hybrids will become a product for  those who are simply seeking efficiency, especially once their preferred  model becomes available with hybrid technology.</p>
<h3 id="Social-CulturalTrends">Social-Cultural Trends</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges to the hybrid automobile market is that  some buyers are confused about the technology.  For example, some fear  that the vehicle’s battery might run dry and leave them stranded  (Maynard, 2007).  Another common concern over the hybrid vehicle is that  the purchaser will not save enough on gasoline to make a hybrid worth  the additional cost.  Educating the public about hybrid technology will  help increase demand for these vehicles in the long-run.</p>
<h3 id="Political-LegalTrends">Political-Legal Trends</h3>
<p>California recently passed legislation that allows hybrid cars to travel  in high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lanes, typically reserved for vehicles  with more than one passenger, on highways.  The law was passed to  support California’s goal of promoting fuel conservation and reducing  air pollutant emissions (Reynolds, 2004).  Although the legislation will  not significantly shift demand for hybrids, it does provide rewards for  those who purchase the environmentally friendly vehicles.  As the  technology is developed and performance improves among hybrid products,  future incentives and favorable legislation is expected to pass  throughout the country.  This will gradually result in an increase in  product demand.</p>
<h2 id="CompetitorAsessessment">Competitor Asessessment</h2>
<p>In order to analyze the hybrid automobile market and industry, one must  examine the role competition plays and how marketers can best manage  their brands based on their market position.</p>
<h3 id="HybridAutomotiveIndustry">Hybrid Automotive Industry</h3>
<p>The Automotive Manufacturing industry has seen some changes in the past  several years and those new developments have led to the creation of the  smaller Hybrid Automotive Manufacturing industry. In the beginning,  automakers didn’t want to look into the development of hybrid powered  vehicles because of the high cost and the many risks involved. Because  of new legislation, they had no choice and had to come up with the  technology to make fuel-efficient cars.  Automakers decided that  electric cars would be the best way to meet the legislation demands.  “Early models were unpopular because of slow cruising speeds and lack of  performance, but by the end of the century, electric car production  began to be practical.” (Motor Vehicles). At the end of the 1990’s  manufacturers was coming up with the technology to produce internal  combustion engine with an electric motor. Toyota pioneered the hybrid  automotive industry by providing a mass-market hybrid vehicle to  consumers in the United States in 1999. While the first five years were  somewhat of a learning period for the hybrid automotive industry, 2004  marked a turning point as an increasing number of new models and  manufacturers begin to incorporate the hybrid system. The industry  consists of companies around the world. Toyota Motor Corporation leads  the industry in revenue, with Honda Motor Company, and Ford Motor  Company following. Currently only 1.26% of automobile sales in the  United States are hybrid vehicles (Blogspot.com, 2007).</p>
<h3 id="HybridAutomotiveIndustrysFiveCompetitiveForces">Hybrid Automotive Industry’s Five Competitive Forces</h3>
<p>Competitive advantage is a company’s ability to perform in ways that  competitors cannot match, but few competitive advantages are  sustainable. According to Michael Powers, there are five forces of  competition that determine the long run attractiveness of a market or  market segment. The five competitive forces consist of threat of new  entrants, power of suppliers, power of buyers, availability of  substitutes, and competitive rivalry as seen in Figure 3, the Five  Forces Determining Segment (Kotler &amp; Keller, 2006).</p>
<p>Generally, the threat of new entrants to various industries is high if  economies of scale are low, but because only 466,875 hybrid vehicles  were sold compared to 3,238,482 non-hybrid vehicles in 2006  (Blogspot.com, 2007), it can be argued that the low economies of scale  open the door for new threats. On the other hand, there are many factors  that counter the threat of new entrants into the hybrid automobile  industry. Hybrid automobile product differentiation is fairly high as  each of these vehicles varies in areas of design, size, gas mileage, and  hybrid technology. The automobile industry requires high capital and  requirements to enter the hybrid industry can be even higher.  Additionally, switching costs to the buyer are high because of search  costs, financial risks, research and education, negotiation, and efforts  to sell pre-existing vehicles.  Even though the threat of new entrants  is fairly low, the power of suppliers in the hybrid industry is higher  than desirable. The raw materials to manufacture automobiles are easily  available, but the batteries, regenerative breaks, and the software  engineering specific to hybrid technology are difficult to find among  suppliers and there are limited substitutes. The importance of the  customer to the suppliers is low, because the suppliers don’t  necessarily depend on hybrid vehicle buyers to sustain business. There  are other products on the market that utilize similar suppliers for  similar items. Costs to switch from one supplier to another are fairly  high. Costs include relationship building efforts, financial risk,  potential exit fees, and search costs for locating suppliers who offer  specific hybrid technology.</p>
<p>Unlike suppliers, buyer’s have little power in the hybrid industry. The  volume of purchase is low as only 1.26% of automobile sales in the  United States are hybrid vehicles. The hybrid vehicles do differ  significantly between one another. The cost savings from the products  are low in the short term and high in the long term. Although only six  major companies sell hybrid vehicles, they are major players within the  industry and hybrids are highly available and sold at thousands of  dealerships across the country, online, or through independent sellers.  Hybrid vehicles are still fairly new products and the availability of  substitutes within the industry is currently low. Those that do exist  are not significantly experiencing substantial profitability over one  another and the quality of substitutes is not drastically high or low  compared to one another.</p>
<p>Competitive rivalry is minimal in the hybrid automobile industry today.  There are only eleven competing products and six competitors within the  industry. Exit barriers are fairly low as all companies that manufacture  hybrid vehicles also manufacture non-hybrid vehicles. The millions of  dollars spent on plants, equipment, and human resources would not  necessarily be lost if they were to leave the hybrid industry. There are  some specialized engineering and technical staff exit costs, but not  enough to consider the exit barriers substantially high. The industry  growth rate is high, hybrid car sales increased 26.6% from 2005 to 2006  (Blogspot.com, 2007), therefore the potential for competitive rivalry is  reduced. Additionally, because product differentiation among hybrids is  high and switching costs for the customers are high, competitive  rivalry becomes lower.</p>
<h3 id="BarrierstoEntry">Barriers to Entry</h3>
<p>In the hybrid industry, there are three main barriers to entry:  technology, cost, and brand loyalty. The technology to enable a hybrid  petroleum-electric vehicle is new and expensive. The research and  development costs are much higher than for conventional petroleum  engines. On top of the expenses, the time needed to develop the  technology is also another barrier. There are options around that, such  as licensing the technology from a competing company, but that  information will not come cheaply. The extra costs of the technology end  up being subsidized by higher initial costs for the consumer, as  hybrids typically cost around $2500-$3000 more than their non-hybrid  counterparts. Finally, consumers can be extremely loyal to a certain  make or model of vehicle due to past experiences. This not only includes  particular makes or models, but also other factors such as where the  car was manufactured. A new hybrid vehicle will have the same  difficulties any new model vehicle will have on top of the other  barriers to entry.</p>
<h3 id="HybridAutomotiveIndustrysDrivingForces">Hybrid Automotive Industry’s Driving Forces</h3>
<p>The hybrid automobile industry’s driving forces consist of value,  protecting the environment, safety and reliability, reputation and  loyalty, and finally innovation.</p>
<p>Research studies have proven that all hybrid vehicles have a better  total cost of ownership over five years or 70,000 miles than the  non-hybrid vehicles. More specifically, the study concludes that a  Toyota Prius owner over five years will have $13,408 over a similar size  sedan that is not a hybrid (O’Dell, 2007). These facts allow the  industry to argue that even though their products initially have higher  price points, approximately $2500 to $3000 more, eventually the initial  costs will turn into substantial savings.</p>
<p>There are several other consumer benefits that offer value and help  market hybrid vehicles. The most well known benefit is that of improved  fuel economy. Some hybrid vehicles allow consumers to achieve 44 miles  per gallon compared to other vehicles at about 20 miles per gallon. This  benefit allows consumers to travel much further without having to  refuel, but more importantly saves them substantial dollars by not  having to pay for as much gasoline. Other consumer benefits include tax  credits ranging from $250 to $3,150, special access to HOV lanes on busy  highways, employee incentives from employers, and insurance discounts  where insurance companies such as Farmers Insurance offer a 5-percent  discount to hybrid vehicle owners in California and St. Paul Travelers  offer a 10-percent discount to hybrid owners nationwide (Mello, 2006).</p>
<p>The environment is another driving force behind the hybrid automobile  industry. A common trend seen today is the desire to produce “green”  products, those which are environmentally friendly. The automobile  industry is responsible for creating many products which send pollutants  into our ozone, so the creation of hybrid vehicles served not only to  provide a product which was attractive to the newly growing target  market, but to also display corporate responsibility by contributing  efforts to protecting the environment.</p>
<p>Another driving force of the hybrid industry is the competitive quality.  Hybrid vehicles have proven to exist without compromising the quality  and safety of vehicles. They are just as practical and safe as other  non-hybrid vehicles and their performance has met or exceeded  competition. They offer the same amount of power, their maintenance  costs are equivalent and some of the products, such as the Toyota Prius,  have regenerative breaks which allow customers to go 85,000 miles  before having to replace their brakes (Mello, 2006).</p>
<p>Most companies producing hybrid vehicles have advantages because their  pre-existing non-hybrid vehicles have already established good  reputations and customer loyalty. Consumers will most likely be inclined  to purchase hybrid vehicles from companies with whom they have  purchased past vehicles. For example, Toyota has strong brand  recognition and a reputation for manufacturing high quality vehicles  which can easily be carried over to the hybrid vehicles with little  effort. Lastly, consumers today are obsessed with having the latest  technology and hybrid vehicles are the epitome of high tech vehicles  that continue to meet consumer’s basic needs in a vehicle today.</p>
<h3 id="HybridAutomotiveIndustrySuccessFactors">Hybrid Automotive Industry Success Factors</h3>
<p>The ability for hybrid automobiles to succeed today is measured  according to several key success factors.  Limitations among suppliers  cause poor or restricted manufacturing efficiency.  The industry needs  to be able to decrease supplier power thus increasing control of  production quality and quantity.  While the cost recovery of hybrids is a  selling point, for the industry to be successful it is necessary that  hybrid products appeal to consumers independently of fluctuations in the  economy. The industry needs to make efficiency and reduced emissions a  priority above saving money at the pump.  As with any new technology  consumer education must preempt adoption.  The novelty of a new  technology only draws a small crowd, for hybrids to be fully successful  manufacturers need to ramp up efforts to educate and inform consumers  about the hybrid engine and break down myths which might hurt their  industry.  Another key success factor involves continuing to introduce  hybrid vehicle technology through already familiar products.  Pre-existing models, such as the Lexus RX, simply incorporated hybrid  technology into the already popular vehicle.  This allows for better  ease of adoption and the ability for consumers to keep purchasing their  favored vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="DirectandIndirectCompetitors">Direct and Indirect Competitors</h3>
<p>There are both direct and indirect competitors that satisfy the same customer need that hybrid vehicles offer.</p>
<p>Direct competitors consist of the following:<br />
Toyota Prius	Lexus RX Hybrid<br />
Toyota Camry	Ford Escape<br />
Toyota Highlander	Saturn Vue Green Line<br />
Honda Civic	Mercury Mariner<br />
Honda Accord	Nissan Altima<br />
Lexus GS Hybrid</p>
<p>Indirect competitors consist of the following:<br />
Scooter	Subway<br />
Motorcycle	Bus<br />
Light rail	Non-hybrid vehicles</p>
<p>Almost all of these competitors, with the exception of non-hybrid  vehicles, offer modes of transportation with reduced customer costs and  some form of environmental benefit.</p>
<h3 id="CompetitorsCompetitiveAdvantagesandDisadvantages">Competitor’s Competitive Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Hybrid vehicles are one of many alternative fuel technologies seeking to  fill the needs of fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. These  technologies are being researched by private institutions, government  facilities, automotive startup companies, and existing automotive  manufacturers.  Two competing technologies explored here are Hondas  research into a cleaner diesel engine, and Ford&#8217;s R&amp;D incorporating  E85 ethanol based fuel.</p>
<p>Honda has also jumped onto the hybrid bandwagon, improving upon their  already fuel efficient cars. While Honda is also pursuing hybrid  technology in their vehicles, they have also invested in new diesel  technologies. The new diesel engines will meet all pollution  requirements across the United States. While diesel is even more  expensive than normal gasoline in the United States, diesel vehicles can  provide 30% more fuel efficiency (Ohnsman &amp; Lippert, 2006). Diesel  in the United States has a reputation for not only being more  environmentally damaging, but also more expensive. The challenge for  Honda will be in educating and convincing consumers that their new  diesel engines are not the same as those that are currently out on the  road.</p>
<p>Ford has decided to pursue E85 ethanol based fuel for their new hybrid  vehicles. Dubbed FlexFuel, this alcohol based fuel can reduce emissions  by about 25% (Ford unveils flex-fuel hybrid research vehicle, 2005).  Another advantage is that FlexFuel engines are capable of running both  E85 fuel as well as regular gasoline, thus allowing the consumer more  options. Unlike hybrid vehicles, FlexFuel vehicles do not carry a  premium on the sticker price. This will allow for a higher level of  market penetration, while delivering more value to the consumer.  Although this seems like a winning strategy for Ford, the lack of  available E85 fuel stations and producers has increased fuel prices. On  top of this, E85 delivers 40% less fuel efficiency, thus requiring more  fuel to travel the same amount of distance.</p>
<h3 id="ToyotasAdvantagesandDisadvantages">Toyota’s  Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Even though the number of competitors is small, Toyota leads the  industry and must keep a close eye on its own advantages and  disadvantages. By introducing a brand new vehicle with a distinct new  look, Toyota has also made it easy for consumers to not only drive a  more environmentally friendly vehicle, but proudly show it off as well.  In 2003, Toyota brought 26 Prius model hybrids to the Oscars, where  celebrities such as Cameron Diaz were being photographed with them  (Welch et al., 2007). This has helped with the trend of going green, and  that it is not only good for the environment, but also the cool thing  to do. Toyota sponsors various environmentally based awards in Los  Angeles as well, with their logo at the forefront.</p>
<p>Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive is the leader in hybrid PEHV technology.  They have used this fact heavily in their marketing, and it has paid  off. Whenever a consumer thinks hybrid, Toyota is always going to be on  that list, with the Prius at the top. Toyota is constantly re-factoring  and improving their technology which is now in its fourth generation.  They have been able to keep their vehicles ahead of the game, while  making money off their older technology by selling it to other  manufacturers such as Nissan, who is going to be incorporating the  technology into their Altima (Hybridhippie, 2005). Toyota will also be  able to use the R&amp;D from their current line of hybrids well into the  future and as new fuels and technologies become available; they will be  integrated into the next generation hybrid (Rowley, 2007).</p>
<p>Toyota also has a strong public relations background, which has been  particularly effective in marketing their hybrid vehicles. Combined with  Honda, Toyota lobbied for the inclusion of the hybrid tax credit. One  of the sponsors of the bill, Jay Rockefeller, received a $1 million  grant from Toyota for the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences (Welch et  al., 2007). Before the Prius launched, Toyota asked for a seal of  approval from the director of global warming initiatives at the Sierra  Club. It was a little later that the Sierra Club created an award for  the best hybrid technology, which the Prius won the following year. With  Toyota having many of their factories within the United States and  employing over 38,000 Americans, some have argued that Toyota is even  more American than the American companies are. Although there has been  cultural bias in car purchasing in the past, Toyota has managed to shape  itself into a strong American brand by also sponsoring livestock shows,  bass-fishing tournaments, and NASCAR.</p>
<p>Toyota will be challenged with the new EPA MPG estimates this year.  Because all vehicles will be measured differently, almost all will see a  percentage decrease in their estimated fuel efficiency, but hybrids  will take the largest hit. The gap between hybrids and non-hybrids will  be smaller than before, and with gas prices stabilizing again, sales are  also slowing down. Tax incentives are also no longer going to be  provided by the government, thus increasing the cost of ownership once  again.</p>
<p>Toyota will also have a disadvantage if the technology used in their  hybrid vehicles no longer increases by a significant amount after each  generation. Although it is unlikely that Toyota won’t be able to  continue to innovate, certain technologies, such as the battery, have  already hit technological walls. Even outside the automotive industry,  batteries have barely improved. This could be an issue that even Toyota  will not be able to address in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>Since the hybrid technology is young and rapidly changing, the  likelihood of competitive responses to the industry is high. Alternative  or improved technologies such as plug-in hybrids, bio-fuels, and new  diesel will most likely appear and increase competition. As the hybrid  automobiles’ become more common and unit sales increases, it is most  likely that price points will drop as a competitive response. Other  responses might include extra resources dedicated to hybrid marketing  strategies, and the development of new hybrid vehicle designs to satisfy  the needs of high-end consumers who desire “sexy” vehicles.</p>
<h2 id="SWOTAnalysis">SWOT Analysis</h2>
<p>Toyota has different strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats  as it relates to the company as a whole and, specifically, to their  hybrid vehicles.  Figure 4, Toyota Hybrid SWOT Analysis, outlines each  component of the SWOT analysis as it relates to the marketing mix as  well as key macro environments.  Specific to Toyota hybrids, they  leverage the strength of Toyota’s strong brand elements and leadership  in this emerging technology while significant weaknesses include  cannibalization of existing Toyota products.<br />
Toyota faces the threat of consumer perception and reputation of hybrids  that often includes poor acceleration and a lack of power.  This threat  is not unique to Toyota and is an issue that all hybrid manufacturers  must address. Opportunities surrounding the hybrids for Toyota and other  manufacturers include the “Green” movement, which promotes  environmental responsibility, and legislation that supports this  movement.</p>
<p>Toyota’s strengths as a company include an increase in profitability in  recent years, highly targeted and successful marketing, and a commitment  to lean manufacturing.  Fluctuating economic and political conditions  present a threat to Toyota.  Opportunities for Toyota have been  generated by unique and innovative new-product designs while threats the  company faces as a whole include product recalls.  See Appendix 1,  Toyota SWOT Analysis, for a comprehensive assessment of Toyota’s  strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</p>
<h3 id="EnvironmentalProtectionAgencyMPGEstimates">Environmental Protection Agency MPG Estimates</h3>
<p>The automotive industry is facing a change with the upcoming changes to  the Environmental Protection Agency’s miles per gallon ratings (EPA  MPG).  In 2008, all automobile manufacturers must adhere to new EPA MPG  calculation formulas that will include air conditioning use and winter  driving conditions.  Kettering University professor Craig Hoff stated  that “They’re trying to make them (fuel economy figures) more  representative of what you’re going to get when you have that vehicle”  (Devine, 2007).  As stated before, while this change will impact all  makes and models, it will have a significant impact on vehicles with  high EPA MPG estimates, including Hybrids. The Toyota Prius EPA MPG City  will be revised from 60 MPG to 48 MPG in 2008.</p>
<p>This change results in a threat to hybrid vehicles as the miles per  gallon estimates are one of their strongest selling points and will be  most severely impacted by the change in EPA MPG.</p>

Primary Market Research – Toyota Dealerships and Hybrid Consumers<br />
In conducting primary market research, we found a variety of factors  that influenced buyer behavior among hybrid customers and potential  customers and encountered some surprises as it relates to hybrid sales  at Toyota dealerships.<br />
Mountain States Toyota is a significant Toyota dealer in the Denver  metropolitan area, located at Highway 36 and Interstate 25.  Our  research found that Mountain States Toyota was much less knowledgeable  about Toyota Hybrid vehicles than traditional Toyotas.  The salesman at  Mountain States Toyota continually repeated that Toyota has sold their  previous generation hybrid technology to Honda and that Toyota hybrids  utilize a fourth generation technology (personal communication, February  16, 2007).  When literature on Toyota’s Prius and Camry hybrid models  was requested, we were told that they were currently out.<br />
During an interview with a current Toyota Prius owner, we asked Gary  Gaudin of Erie, Colorado (personal communication, February 17, 2007)  what motivated him to purchase a hybrid and why he chose a Toyota.  He  indicated that he chose to purchase a hybrid primarily to maximize his  miles per gallon and reduce his fuel expense.  Gary also indicated that  he felt good about lessening the environmental impact he was having,  though he was clear that this was not a significant factor in his buying  decision.  Since purchasing his Toyota Prius hybrid in May of 2006,  Gary indicated that he has been disappointed in the miles per gallon he  is realizing at an average of 45 MPG.  However, he also indicated that  he would purchase a hybrid again and would still have a preference  toward Toyota.<br />
Jim McKenna of Erie, Colorado, (personal communication, February 17,  2007) was considering the purchase of a Honda Civic hybrid in December  of 2005 but opted for a traditional Civic.  At this time, the Civic  hybrid allowed for no customization and had severe availability issues.   Jim could not test drive a Civic hybrid before purchasing it and if he  wanted to specify the color of his hybrid he would need to wait up to  six months for delivery. Finally, he noted that the Honda Civic and  Honda Civic hybrid both offered high MPG estimates, making this factor  negligible.<br />
Our primary market research indicates that Toyota has significant  weaknesses to overcome related to their hybrid models.  Sales force  education and hybrid availability are both significant weaknesses for  Toyota Hybrids while we were able to validate the strength of the Toyota  brand elements and reputation.</p>
<p>Hybrid Positioning Map<br />
Appendix 2, Hybrid Positioning Map, provides a visual representation of  where all available hybrids fall when considering average city and  highway MPG estimates and base MSRP (Manufacturers’ Suggested Retail  Prices).  The Toyota Prius and Honda Civic represent the second quadrant  with high EPA MPG estimates and low base MSRPs while Lexus represents  the fourth quadrant with low EPA MPG estimates and high base MSRPs.  The  majority of hybrid models fall in the third quadrant with a low EPA MPG  estimate and low base MSRP, while there is no hybrid model currently  available representing quadrant one with a high EPA MPG estimate and  high base MSRP.</p>
