<h1>Creating the Plymouth, Dodge, and Chrysler Minivan: <br>
The Caravan/Voyager Development Story</h1>
<p class="center"><img src="/photos/minivans/1984/1984-plymouth-voyager.jpg" alt="1984 Plymouth Voyager" width="792" height="292"></p>
<p>Launced in 1983, <a href="/model/m/original-minivans.html">Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager</a> were the culmination of over a decade of work. Their development was rejected out of hand by then-president Lynn Townsend, and, according to one engineer, even after it was approved, the minivan was put on hold for the Y-body Imperial. Not until 1980 did full development begin. </p>
<p>When
work on the minivan first started in the 1970s, Chrysler  dominated <a href="/trucks/vans.html">full-sized vans</a>  with a 45% market share; they pioneered using carlike conveniences such as power windows,
good radios, and rear window defrosters. This led to
the idea of a van for families, which would not
cannibalize full sized van sales, but would attract station wagon buyers.</p>
<p><a href="/corporate/bios/bouwkamp.html">Burton Bouwkamp, Chrysler's Director of Product Planning from 1968 to 1975</a>, wrote in a 1998 letter to <i><a href="http://www.autonews.com/">Automotive News</a></i> (which both parties gave us permission to reprint):</p>
<div class="blowup">

<p><img src="/photos/minivans/early-minivan.jpg" alt="early minivan" width="558" height="379" class="aright">In the early and mid-1970s, our Advance Design, Advance Engineering, and Advance Product Planning offices designed first generation versions of the minivan. The program was to design a station wagon type vehicle that was not derived from another vehicle (from a passenger car sedan or a commercial van). <p>
The first generation designs were rear wheel drive because we did not have front wheel drive engines
or transmissions. Product planners, designers, and
engineers were enthusiastic about the mini-van (which we called a
"garageable van") but were unable to get management approval to go
forward with a unique product concept which had a special tooling bill, not including facilities, of over $100 million. The first designs
never went beyond the clay model, advanced design and seating buck
stage - but the interest in the concept in the Design and Product
Planning offices at Chrysler continued.</p><p>The âbean counterâ management didn't approve the minivan in the early 1970s because GM and Ford didn't have one. Top management's contention was that, if there was a market, GM and Ford would be building one. Management was, without articulating it, deciding that our product strategy was to get 15% of market segments established by GM and Ford. As Director of Product Planning for seven years, that was a painful realization to me; thatâs why I lobbied to get out of the job in 1975 when a Director level product Â job opened up in Europe.</p><p>
<img src="../images/omnivan.jpg" alt="Dodge Omni based concept minivan" class="aright" border="1" height="193" width="360">The second generation design, in the late 1970s, was essentially the
production design and was done by Chrysler Design Office personnel
under the capable and enthusiastic direction of Hal Sperlich. By then
we had <a href="/omni/omni.html">front wheel drive Omni/Horizon cars</a> under way, so the mini-van
design became front wheel drive, which allowed significant improvements in the package dimensions. Hal Sperlich contributed greatly to the success of the program with
his enthusiastic involvement, esthetic input, and overall guidance of
the program. </p><p>When Lee saw our minivan work (our second generationÂ design),  he said âlet's do it.â Bill McGagh (Assistant Treasurer) told him that we (Chrysler) didn't have the money to do a minivan; Lee told him to âget the blankety-blank money,â then replaced Bill with aÂ new Treasurer.Â  Lee Iacocca gets credit for his support and the âgutsâ
decision to go ahead with a now even-more-expensive FWD product at a
time when the Corporation was having trouble paying its bills and
maintaining product competitiveness in existing market segments.</p><p>Hal Sperlich and Lee Iacocca should get credit for the
final design execution and the decision to go ahead with production of
the mini-van program at Chrysler - but not the idea.</p>
</div>
<p>Glenn Gardner, Dodge Truck product planning manager in the late
1970s (and future leader of the <a href="../intrepid.html">LH car project</a>), was given the job of turning âSuper Wagonâ concept into
a real vehicle. Full-size clay models and engineering studies were created by
around 100 designers from a variety of Chrysler organizations.
Customers
rejected aerodynamic extremes; they also disliked the existing van practice of having engines tunneling into the cabin, leading engineers to decide that front wheel
drive was the only way to go. </p>
<p>There were practically no components at Chrysler for front wheel drive cars when the minivan project was first launched. The <a href="../../eek/k/k.html">K cars</a> were being developed. The <a href="../horizon.html">Horizon</a>, while it had an advanced suspension and front wheel drive, had been developed by the former <a href="../eurocc.html">Rootes Group and Simca</a> and their engines were not powerful enough. The <a href="../../slant6.html">slant six engine</a>,
natural for a minivan, was too large and would have demanded rear wheel drive. The Horizon platform was
considered, but the minivan was eventually to be <i>based on </i>the larger K
platform. (Burton Bouwkamp pointed out: âK-BodyÂ and T-115 minivan were different platforms. They did have a common East-West FWD powertrain but the vehicle body structures were different. To have common platforms the front wheel position, base of windshield â cowl height âÂ and driver's âHâ point must be identical.â</p>
<div class="sidebar"><p><i>Chris Theodore wrote</i>: One day I got bored and decided to design a new vehicle - by that time Hal Sperlich had come over and we were working on the K car - so I went back on the drafting board and I started drawing up a minivan. And it was funny at the time.</p><p><img src="/model/images/1984-dodge-caravan.jpg" alt="1984 dodge caravan" width="432" height="193" class="aright">The union came over after a while and said  they loved me, but âYou canât draft.â I said, âCan I do a tape drawing?â They said yes. So, of course, I did a tape drawing of a minivan based on K-car components.</p><p>I went back and I drew it all up on the K-car components and showed it to my bossâs boss, and he didnât like it. The guyâs name was âLeftyâ Carlstad. I showed it to the chief engineer of Dodge Truck at the time and he pulled a cigar out of his mouth and said âthatâs not a truck!â and he threw me out of his office. So we went back and worked on some other stuff. </p><p>About a year later, the chief body engineer, Leo Walsh, called me up and said âChris, remember that minivan you were doing? Yeah. Show it to me again.â Now Hal Sperlich was asking about minivans because he had been trying to get one done at Ford.</p><p>Itâs not like I invented the minivan. I was just an excited young kid. I went running down there and took the tape drawing with me, showed it to him, unrolled it. He looked at it and sayid, âOh, yeah, I remember that. Thanks, Chris,â and rolled it up and didnât say anything else. </p></div>

<p>Research conducted in 1978 showed that customers needs included parking in the garage, large interior
space (at least four feet high, five feet wide, and ten feet long) with a
side door opening of at least 30 inches, 48 inches between wheel wells for
plywood, the ability to seat three people across, a flat
floor, the ability to walk from one end of the van to the other, and
removable seats. </p>
<p><span class="center"><img src="/photos/plymouth/voyager/1984-voyager-cutaway.jpg" alt="1984 plymouth voyager cutaway" width="792" height="350"></span></p>
<p>The sliding door was used based on
customer input: people felt it was safer when dealing with children. It
would not blow closed, it provided plenty of access room, and it was
less likely to trap fingers. Two sliding doors were originally proposed, though the second door would not arrive for many years, according to Burton Bouwkamp:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was Director of Body Engineering, I repeatedly recommended that we built the first mini-vans with an opening left rear door. I guess I made a pest of myself because Hal Sperlich (my boss) took me aside and told me privately not to bring up that proposal again. </p><p>In Product Planning we always envisioned the T-115 to be a &quot;peoplemover&quot; with four side doors and a hatch. (TheÂ right side onlyÂ sliding door on theÂ 1984 model was to be sure that the mini-van appealed to commercial customers.)Â </p><p>Hal didn't want to build the vans with both three and four door versions because of the increased manufacturing complexity; and it would have increased the tooling bill. Money was a problem at that time. The Finance Office (Bill McGagh) told Lee Iacocca that we couldn't afford the mini-van [at all]. Lee told Bill to &quot;find the G--- D--- money - that's your job!&quot;.</p></blockquote><p><span class="center"><img src="/photos/minivans/1984/dodge-minivans.jpg" alt="dodge minivans 1984 - 2009" width="792" height="285"></span></p>
<p>Most people wanted bucket front seats. The rear opening preference was divided between a one-piece
lift-gate (preferred by sedan owners) and a station-wagon type two-part
gate (preferred by station wagon owners).</p>
<p>The windows were mounted relatively flush, cutting aerodynamic drag and associated noise. Burton Bouwkamp, head of body engineering at the time the LeBaron was developed, wrote, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/gauges.jpg" alt="1989 Dodge Caravan gauges" class="aright" border="1" height="304" width="412">We had to delay the &quot;<a href="../lancer.html">H&quot; Body (LeBaron GTS / Lancer</a>) more than six months when Hal Sperlich (my boss) saw the latest Toyota Tiger (I think?) and Nissan Leopard cars at the Tokyo Auto Show. After that trip he  decided to move the glass planes outboard on the mini-van by 3/8&quot; to make the  side glass more flush with exterior door and quarter sheet metal. That  involved a complete redesign of glass drop mechanism and door/window seals as well  as exterior sheet metal changes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project had already been delayed somewhat to get some assurance of higher quality. Burton Bouwkamp wrote, âI resolved not to go into production with a less than fully developed product, regardless of pressure. At times, I was unpopular when I told Hal Sperlich (President in 1982-3) that we weren't ready for production. Hal trusted me and supported me even when I did not tell him what he wanted to hear. He then had a bigger problem than I did because he had to tell Lee (Iaccoca).â</p>
<p>Voyager and Caravan were clearly based on the Reliant, and shared a surprising number of parts, including interior trim pieces, the instrument panel, and engines. Still, enthusiast magazines at the time talked about how upscale the controls and trim were.</p>
<p>Lee Iaccoca
committed to get $500 million in funding.
The whole project was to cost $700 million. (Compare that to the <a href="http://www.tgrigsby.com/views/ford.htm">Ford</a> Contour, which reportedly cost nearly $3 <b>b</b>illion.)</p>
<p>Applauded
by automotive magazines, the "T-115" minivans became a major success
from their debut in 1983 (as 1984 models), with 209,895 sold in 1984. St. Louis soon joined Windsor in devoting three shifts to minivan production.</p>

<p>Major changes through the years included the 1987 introduction of a
(Mitsubishi) V-6 engine, fuel injection on the base 2.2 in 1987, a short-lived 2.5 turbo option, extended-wheelbase versions
(the "Grands,") and the supposed âfirst luxury minivan,âÂ the original Town &amp; Country. These versions were fourteen
inches longer, and soon accounted for half of minivan sales. The 2.5
liter engine finally replaced the troublesome Mitsubishi 2.6; it was basically a 2.2 with longer stroke and balance shafts
for smoother operation, which better suited the vans' torque
requirements and were to become the standard engine until the new 2.4 liter engine arrived in 2000 The new 2.4 would survive through model-year 2009 but would only be used in the PT Cruiser (and Russian versions of the Dodge Stratus) after model year 2007. </p>

Roger Lister pointed out:</p><blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../../mopar/transmissions/41TE.html">A-604 electronically controlled 4 speed auto</a>
was introduced in 1989, and the AWD (all wheel drive) was introduced in
1991 with the 3.3 V6. AWD was offered on both short and long wheelbase
vans, but I believe was only offered with the 3.3 and A-604.</p>

<p class="sidebar4"><i><a href="first.html">Chrysler minivan firsts</a></i></p>
<p><a href="/model/caravan.html">Exports to Europe</a> began in 1988, four years after the first Renault Espace
was sold; the Europe-dominating Espace was created by <a href="../../cars/adopted/matra/rancho.html">Matra</a> when that company was owned by Chrysler, and used a Chrysler-owned <a href="/cars/adopted/simca/index.html">SIMCA</a> as its basis. Matra has already sold <a href="/cars/adopted/matra/rancho.html">soft-roader SUVs based on SIMCA chassis</a> as well as <a href="/cars/adopted/matra/murena.html">SIMCA-based sports cars</a>. Since Dodge and Plymouth were not sold in Europe at the time, the Plymouth Voyager minivan was rebadged and modified somewhat to become the Chrysler Voyager, a name that is still in use. </p>
<p>In 1990, a Chrysler-designed V-6, the <a href="../../mopar/33.html">3.3</a>, was added to the mix.
This strong, durable engine proved to be very popular, and remained in
the mix until (as of this writing in 2010) 2010 (possibly 2011).</p>
<h2>Later minivan achievements and milestones</h2>
<ul><li>The
first major redesign was in 1991, and included major changes to the
suspension and steering, optional antilock brakes, standard
shoulder belts for all passengers, and optional all wheel drive. The
next year, driver airbags were made standard, and an integrated child
seat was added as an option. <a href="/model/m/1991-voyager.html">1991-1996 minivans</a>. </li><li>In 1992, Chrysler minivan production in Austria began, with a turbodiesel
Chrysler Voyager appearing in 1993. The Austrian factory, a <a href="../../ed/diesel.html">diesel engine</a>,
and manual transmission brought Chrysler 23% of the European minivan market in 1994. (After Daimler took over Chrysler, Mercedes took over the Austrian factory, and all minivans, regardless of their destination, were made in North America, and sales dropped; see <a href="/model/caravan.html">European Chrysler minivans</a>.)</li><li>In 1992, a Dodge Caravan with an airbag earned the best scores ever recorded for a van in the U.S. governmentâs crash test program.</li><li><img src="../images/epic.jpg" alt="Dodge Epic concept electric minivan" width="412" height="194" border="0" class="aright">In 1993, the <a href="/corporate/electric-cars.html">first electric minivan, the TEVan</a>, was launched; it was sold mainly to electric utilities, which could sell or scrap them later; many were sold at public auctions, and some are still in use. </li><li>A <a href="/model/m/CNG-van.html">V6-powered minivan that ran on compressed natural gas</a> was also produced starting in 1993.</li><li>Though the second generation of minivans was drawing to a close, <a href="/model/m/1994.html">numerous changes were made to enhance the 1994-95 models</a>. </li><li>1996 brought another major redesign, which greatly increased interior space, comfort, and reliability. <a href="/history/interviews/chris-theodore/neon-minivans.html">Hereâs an inside story</a>.</li>
<li>Chrysler's second electric minivan, the <a href="/corporate/electric-cars.html">EPIC</a> (pictured below) was introduced in July 1997. </li><li>The <a href="minivans.html">2001-2007 minivans</a> had more powerful engines, no Mitsubishi option, and
many "fine tuning" improvements, as well as power doors on both sides and in the back.</li><li>In 2003, the Grand Caravan was repackaged to form the <a href="../cs.html"><b>Chrysler Pacifica</b></a>, which ran through 2008.</li><li>The 2005 long-wheelbase vans brought seats that fold into the
floor
("Stow-n-Go"), a feature so popular that Chrysler started to
record increased minivan sales despite the introduction of new Toyota, Ford, Honda, and Nissan minivans. </li><li>The <a href="2008-minivans.html">2008-2010 vans</a> added a new six-speed automatic transmission and 4-liter engines to the top models; in 2009, retuning gave the four-liter engine the highest gas mileage of any minivan sold in 2009-2010, with 17 mpg city, 25 highway. In <a href="/model/m/11-minivans.html">2011</a>, the vans were retuned and again improved, inside and out.<br>
</li></ul>
<h2>Who invented the minivan?</h2>
<p>Chrysler invented the <b>modern</b> minivan (as opposed to the compact van) âtwice, in two different continents, using entirely different bodies. Richard Moss pointed
out that <a href="http://rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-history/history-matra.html">Chrysler Europe was working with Matra</a> on a minivan in the
late 1970s / early 1980s. When it was ready to go into production,
Chrysler sold most of its European operations to Peugeot-Citroen (PSA),
which dumped the fledgling minivan. Matra took the design to Renault,
which modified it to fit the Renault 21 drivetrain...resulting in a
calendar-year 1983 introduction and Europe's most popular minivan. If
Chrysler had held on to Chrysler UK, it may well have had a greater
European foot-hold - but that's another story. The American Plymouth
Voyager and Dodge Caravan were also introduced in 1983, as 1984 models. (<a href="http://rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-history/history-matra.html" target="_blank">The full story is here!)</a></p>

<p>Richard Beck pointed out that the Chevrolet Corvair had a Greenbriar
model, a few came with cargo area
doors on the driver's side. "It is said they had a tendency to break in
half at the midsection because of those two sets of double doors. What
attracted me to the Voyager is the four banger engine with 100 horses
and a five speed. Also it has a tow hitch and roof rack..it's my all-purpose all-sports
car. Hauling a sailboat, or carry a canoe and bicycles, or sleep in it.
I like the power rear vent windows and innovative sliding side door. I
love the lift gate as a porch roof." (There were numerous small vans before the minivan, including the Volkswagen Microbus and <a href="/trucks/vans.html">Dodgeâs own A-vans</a>.)</p>
