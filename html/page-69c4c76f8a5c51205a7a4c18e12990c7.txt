						<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/78-ultimate-muscle-cars.html">Ultimate muscle cars</a></li> No one really needs an 8.0L engine making 400 horsepower when there are technologically advanced ways today that can create the same amount of power in less than half that engine capacity. A large displacement, naturally aspirated V8 engine creates considerable power and torque figures, while having a steady flow of acceleration right up to the redline. A turbocharged smaller displacement engine, V8 or otherwise, creates equal or more power and torque, but sometimes is victim to the much-despised turbo lag that creeps up in forced induction engines.  (Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, Dodge Challenger)<br /><br />
						<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/77-future-mobility-electric-cars-and-biofuel.html">Future Mobility - Electric Cars, Biofuel and Plug-in Hybrid Systems</a></li> The difference between an electric car and a plug-in hybrid is simple. The plug-in hybrid employs both, and electric motor paired to a battery pack, as well as a conventional internal combustion engine, be it petrol or diesel.<br /> <br /> 
						<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/76-tips-for-saving-money-on-auto-insurance.html">Tips for saving money on auto insurance</a></li> You will usually save money if you insure all of your cars under one auto insurance policy instead of maintaining multiple policies. You might receive a policy discount if you take a defensive driving course, particularly if you are age 55 or older. Taking steps to save money on auto insurance might not be the most exciting task, but reducing your premiums can be well worth your effort. Through careful planning and diligent effort, you might be able to cut your car insurance costs by 40 percent or more. <br /> <br /> 
						<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/49-how-to-sell-your-vehicle-for-the-best-profit.html">How to sell your vehicle for the best profit?</a></li> When your buyer offers to pay you for your car, you can carry out this transaction at a bank of your choice. Make sure that the funds are secure before transferring the title of the vehicle to the buyer.<br /><br />

The gearbox is an evolution of the SMG unit fitted to M3s, but much more satisfactory. Gear changes are smooth and with 7 ratios available they're tightly enough packed to give you all the power you need, just when you need it.  <br /> <br />
						<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/60-car-rental-company.html">Six things your car rental company won't tell you</a></li> While most major car rental companies allow you to make online reservations ahead of time, reserving a rental car online doesn't guarantee that the car you selected will actually be available when you come to pick it up. <br /><br />
						<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/52-how-to-make-your-own-fuel.html">How to make your own fuel?</a></li>If you are concerned about the damage to the environment caused by petrol fumes, or just want a cheaper alternative to petrol, why not think about making your own fuel to run in your car? More than two million cars in the United States have already been equipped with E85 technology. The E85 refers to the fact that the car runs on eighty-five per cent ethanol, with the remaining fifteen per cent being made up of gasoline. <br />	<br />	
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/58-flexible-fuel-vehicles.html">Flexible fuel vehicles</a></li> If you are in the market for a new car, you have likely discovered that new car fuel choices are no longer a simple matter of leaded versus unleaded or diesel fuel versus gas. New cars now run on electricity, gas, diesel, and biofuels such as ethanol.<br />	<br />

Beloved for its characteristic style, punchy engine, and lively handling, the Mini Cooper has not only conquered the city streets, it has dominated many motor racing disciplines throughout the decades. The 2011-model Cooper receives a more aggressive front grille, LED rear lights, and headlights that swivel when the car turns. The interior retains its art-deco quirkiness with just minor changes to some trimmings.<br /><br />
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/59-tips-for-buying-a-used-car.html">Tips for buying a used car. How to buy a car online?</a></li> Often when looking for a used vehicle, you need it immediately and hope for a quick and easy purchase. A reputable car dealer should already have the Carfax Vehicle History Report printed and available to potential buyers. Take the vehicle to your reliable mechanic and have him or her check out the vehicle before you make the final decision.<br /><br />	
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/79-seven-signs-a-used-car-has-serious-problems.html">Seven signs a used car has serious problems</a></li> Buying any car can be a stressful experience, whether the car is used or new. With new cars, though, the experience can become even more stressful if after the purchase has been completed you find that the car has major mechanical problems.<br /><br />	
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/50-the-toyota-corolla.html">The Toyota Corolla</a></li> The Toyota Corolla features driver's and passenger airbags, a sporty design, and we opted for the 5-speed manual transmission. It's also available in 4-speed automatic. So off to the Toyota dealership we went and picked out a sensibly beige Sienna. <br /><br />
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/56-will-hybrids-go-mainstream.html">Will hybrids go mainstream?</a></li> Hybrids didn't really take off until Honda introduced the first hybrid car to the Canadian/U.S. market, the 2-door Insight. Among hybrids which retained a respectable segment of the market during that same time period were the Lexus RX 400h luxury utility vehicle, the LS 600h L Hybrid luxury sedan, the GS 450h, the Honda Civic Hybrid, the Accord Hybrid, and the Nissan Altima.<br /><br />
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/53-top-luxury-trends-for-the-well-heeled-driver.html">Top luxury auto sales trends for the well heeled driver</a></li> In order to keep up, makers of luxury automobiles are going further than ever before, and that is good news for buyers.  Most luxury dealerships provide auto sales leads, software or auto sales training so the salesperson will engage with you. <br /><br />
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/55-diesel-vs-gasoline-engines.html">Diesel vs. gasoline engines</a></li> Today, gasoline engines are used to power most passenger cars and trucks whereas diesel engines are used mainly in large commercial vehicles and heavy duty trucks.  Diesel engines are designed to produce a large amount of power at relatively low engine speeds, which makes them ideal for towing and hauling.<br /><br />

				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/54-when-should-you-buy-a-car-warranty.html">When should you buy a car warranty?</a></li> How do you get the best deal on a new car warranty the dealer wants to push on you? The extent of repairs, what you will pay and how much the dealership will pay for those repairs is determined by the terms of the policy, or warranty. Because new car warranties are basically a profit center for auto dealerships, they're going to push real hard to get you to buy the most expensive coverage. In most cases there are no bad credit auto sales or auto loans.<br /><br />
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/61-what-are-the-top-10-cars-for-women.html">What are the top 10 cars for women?</a></li> There is a reason that the Honda Accord is so popular: this car is perfect for families. Edmunds loves how Honda designed plenty of room inside, complete with thoughtful additions, while making it as easy to drive as a compact. Both reliable and safe, this car delivers the whole package. Even women with an aversion to minivans can appreciate the attention to detail in the Toyota Sienna.<br /><br />
	            <li><a href="/blog/2-autos/62-the-all-new-lexus-ct-200h.html">The all-new Lexus Ct 200h</a></li> This may be a hybrid, but it is also a luxury car. This means you should expect luxury features, a category in which the Ct 200h is not lacking. Then interior of this car is absolutely stunning. Best time to finance this car or get a car loan.<br /><br />
				<li><a href="/blog/2-autos/63-the-electric-car.html">The electric car: past, present and future</a></li> Although electric cars are just now becoming common around the globe, they have actually been around for a long time. The first electric-powered vehicles were invented back in the 1800s. It wasn't until 1999, when Honda introduced the Insight hybrid, that alternative power cars found a serious niche in the automotive marketplace. <br /><br />

 Auto leasing is big business and unfortunately there are some rogue dealerships out there that are less than honest with buyers about the terms of their lease. One common auto leasing gimmick is to sell you on a deceptively low interest rate when in actuality you are paying more than double what you thought was the case.   When you are lured in by deals such as a 3% interest rates on leased vehicles, it may sound too good to be true and often it is.  If you are leasing a new vehicle that is still covered by a factory warranty, you have no need for this type of coverage.  Furthermore, what they neglect to tell you about the refundable nature of these policies is that your so-called refund is prorated and you can expect little if any money back in return.<br /><br />
