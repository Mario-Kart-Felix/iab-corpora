<b>Color:</b> Black <b>Trans:</b> Manual <b>Mileage:</b> 140K <b>Price:</b> $6500<br>
Parting ways with my 2007 9-5 Aero.  I bought it last fall to be my daily driver and then inherited two cars in the last two weeks from a very generous uncle. I travel a lot for work and have not driven it as much as I thought so it makes it that much easier to part with.  We have two drivers and six cars so two of them are going.  I just replaced the turbo and put new rubber and brakes when I bought it.  It goes like he!! and is a very fun car to drive.  There are a few issues - the backup sensor does not work and I did not have it repaired because it involved taking off the bumper $$.  the car backs up and that is all I care about.  there are a few scratches and a ripple dent on the L/R 1/4 that is visible from an angle.  I am not dying to sell it but I either need to sell two cars or hire a valet to park them.

This is a beautiful and rare piece that you wont be able to find any where in this area. I did the research, the closest one is in Concord and has almost 4 times the miles as mine. 13,198 on the odometer, this car was hardly driven and very well maintained. Both keys are available, I also have a set of custom made and very expensive floor mats. These come with the car. The exterior, not a ding, scratch or defect at all. Dark tint that accompanies the brilliant silver metallic paint job. A large panoramic sun roof that opens up the interior and looks great from the outside. 18&quot; wheels wrapped in new rubber.

My 6th Saab and by far the best!  A classic 95 Aero with manual transmission, and all the trimmings, even the ventilated seats! Religiously maintained, with good rubber (Continental DWS), and recent AC overhaul that included a new compressor! Enjoy the spirited Aero performance, or just escape the heat in the luxuriously frigid cabin. Purchased from the second-owner in 2005, this Saab remains dependable, solid, and a joy to drive. Only selling to make room for a friend's Audi S6, that he's letting me steal. Prefer that it goes to a Saab enthusiast, and am flexible on price to assure it finds a good home. Will throw-in (4) winter tires mounted on OEM alloy wheels.<br clear="left">

Wagon was well taken care of by my wife, a real Saab lover.   Unfortunately, it recently developed a leak on the transmission cooler line and was immediately taken off the road.   It has a ski rack and bike mounts, great tires, a ding in the rear street side passenger door, and a screwed up environmental control.   I have 2 junk yard ABS modules to go along with it.   There is a pet &quot;fence&quot;.   Interior leather is fine.   Passenger window falls into the door.   Its in Westford, MA.   I can probably get it to you if that's an issue.Email me for more details.  Its a 2.3t.

This is a one owner car, clean title. Everything electrical is working, even the SID, no warning lights and just passed emissions inspection. DIC throttle body, exhaust flexpipe and CPS all done, last service was the 60k inc accessory belt and pulleys along with new platinum plugs. Has had 5k synthetic oil changes. Car runs really nicely, engine pulls strongly no issues. Car has OEM viggen slotted front disks, ASA AR1 18in wheels, and 4 new matching Z rated allseason tires. I have the original 4 BBS RK2 wheels - straight but need refinishing. The only downside, AC isn't working. Diagnosis is requires an evaporator. At the time parts were an issue, but 2 part repair evaporators are available from eeuroparts again now, around $400 so with labor you're at $900 based on info on the forum. Can gladly take additional detailed photos and answer any questions on request.<br clear="left">

Selling my beloved '03 9-5 that I bought new in 10/2002.  The good: bright and shiny paint on a great body (usual door dings and a couple hail dings on roof and hood), wonderful leather interior and carpet, smooth/straight/quiet ride on four new Coopers with only 12K, cold A/C (locked in recirc), Harman Kardon stereo with SiriusXM (Saab kit), new transmission at 77K.  The bad: water pump leaks, needs O2 sensor (CEL P1141), slight oil leak.  The ugly: cracked windshield.  Oil changes every 5K from 30K onward using Mobil 1.  Perfect for a parent looking for a safe/solid car for their HS or college student.<br clear="left">

All fluids, tune up and all filters replaced and 4 wheel alighment.This Aero runs and handles beautifully. New Kumho Ecsta LX Platinums recently installed. I have all my records and most from the previous owner. I own two Combi's, I have a 9-3 listed as well. I hope to sell one and keep the other. Call or email with any questions.

2005 Saab 9-5 Arc with only 47,900 miles. Every once in a while, a car comes along that's really special.  Consider this 9-5 Arc.  With it's full 45,000 service just completed (engine oil and filter, automatic transmission flush, brake flush, spark plugs, air filter, cabin filter) it will have to reach 92,000 miles before its next major service is due.  The only other scheduled maintenance due before that is the fuel filter at 60,000 miles.  Coolant flush was performed at 41K miles when the complete heater valve hose assembly was replaced.  DI Cassette and crankshaft position sensor were replace around 36K as can be seen in the CarFax.  New HID bulbs were just installed and the car comes with a spare set.  Other just completed repairs include the Air Filter O-ring, the left front wheel liner, rear license plate bulb, sway bar links, turbo bypass and throttle body vacuum hoses.<br clear="left">

Chili red, tan leather, power sunroof, new Michelins. Exceptionally clean in and out. One owner, with Mobil 1 every 5K. Apart from regular maintenance, there's been just one major warranty repair since new: the A/C, with the problems now long gone.

It's a tight, comfortable, good-handling 9-5, getting 33mpg on road trips and 19mpg in daily use. Located in Sudbury. Massachusetts, this car is as good a quality/price deal as you're likely to find.

One owner car from three Saab family.  Have owned nothing but Saabs since 1983.  Gary Fisher Special Edition (every option available).  Harmon Kardon 200 Watt sound system, heated/cooled front, heated back, moon roof and metallic.  Very clean, used daily since purchase.  Thirteen years of documented service.  Recent years serviced by Saab Doctor of Kansas City.  This guy knows Saabs!  Every early-model 9-5 glitch replaced; ignition module, neutral safety switch, catalytic converter, ABS module, turbo, engine mounts, power windows and sun visor.  Engine replace by Saab at 50,000 miles due to oil sludge problem.  Four matching tires with good tread.   Rear muffler, serpentine belt and fuel pump recently replace.  Everything works except; A/C (great through last summer, currently out), drivers memory seat (adjustable controls all work but not from memory), fog lights removed because of cracked lenses but included with sale.  Emblems replaced twice but currently worn-off.  Brakes could use update.

1999  2.3L was in a front end crash in December. Replaced grill, headlight, radiator and hood with a blue hood (car is green). Radiator support is bent, so only one pin engages to hold the hood shut. Major problem is a coolant leak which I can't figure out. Can usually drive about 40 miles before needing to add coolant. It's not the radiator or upper/lower hoses. Front brakes are new, wheels and tires are pretty good, SID is good. Interior is pretty good. Body is OK, several scratches, minor rust. Exhaust will need repair soon. Also hard to start when hot (maybe CPS?). Maybe just good for parts at this point.<br clear="left">

How many SAABs do I need? Not sure. Recently bought an Aero I couldnâ€™t refuse and now thinking about selling my 1999 9-5. Or not. Second owner since 60k. All services past 5 years done by Swedish Garage, Charlotte, including 5k oil changes and all major services. Now needs its first turbocharger replacement so trying to decide whether to keep or sell. Slight radiator seepage for the past few years. Plastic border of windshield warped from age but ok. Gas gauge occasionally fitful but settles down within a few miles. Trunk remote occasionally non-compliant. Everything else fully functional. Good Michelins. Fairly rare 5 speed and color.

This 9-5 is in great shape, it has been a local car to Georgia its whole life, so no salt or rust. The car is in excellent shape inside and out and with only 125k miles it has plenty more years and miles left to go. This car has only been serviced at our local Atlanta Saab dealer. The vehicle is pristine inside and out. Recent work done on the car are as follows. Timing belt and tensioners serpentine belt and tensioner, tires, front and rear shocks and struts, headlight relay and bulbs, upper engine mount, valve cover gaskets,battery, heater valve, crank sensor, sway bar link arms, and just alignment done with new tires. I am in the process of taking pictures of the car, and can send them to you. Just contact me if interested.

Low mileage, exceptionally clean 9-5 Sedan. Maintained by certified Saab mechanic. Major service interval was at 67,000 miles. Tires have prox 20K in excellent condition. Two issues with shift lever. Lockout switch malfunctioned and was replaced with an under dash mounted switch. The original lockout will activate about 4 times per year. When this happens the under dash switch overrides it and car starts. 2nd issue is switch for sport mode. Has not worked since I have owned the vehicle...never planned to use it anyway. New windshield will be installed on May 28th. Car Fax info available to serious buyers. Additional pixs here: http://flic.kr/s/aHsjFoskSN
