  <p align="justify">Auto Road Services, Inc. markets 24-hour roadside assistance
    programs and provides access to North America's largest nationwide dispatch
    organization throughout the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) and
    Canada. <br>
    <br>
    ARS was founded in 1991 by Charles O. Grove and is a direct extension of his
    60 years of service in the automotive aftermarket industries. Mr. Grove conceived
    the concept of adding roadside assistance on aftermarket products and innovated
    the combinations of roadside assistance as a value added marketing tool to
    those industries. <br>
    <br>
    Currently, ARS services the largest automotive and aftermarket corporations
    such as Goodyear, Michelin, Bridgstone/Firestone, Exide, Yokohama, Sears,
    Bosch and Goodrich only to name a few.Initally conceived as a purchase incentive
    program for prestige automobiles, roadside assistance not only gives the customer
    added value, but also gives you added profit, increasing buyer incentive to
    purchase more premium products and/or services. Auto Road Services has applied
    this powerful marketing tool to such industries as finance and banking memberships,
    extended warranties, telecommunications, installer services, employee benefits
    and many more. <br>
    <br>
    Auto Road Services has diversified its corporate and aftermarket programs
    to provide service to various markets. These markets include retail automotive
    service chains, insurance and financial companies, institutional lenders,
    credit card companies, extended service contracts, grocery markets, employer
    and membership groups and website sales. <br>
    <br>
    Our dispatch services have access to over 40,000 emergency repair and mobile
    service providers nationwide and in Canada. All are database verified for
    prompt courteous and dependable customer service. In addition, these providers
    are backed by a multi-million dollar insurance umbrella and are continually
    monitored by a database management system. <br>
    <br>
    Mr. Grove's vision has enabled Auto Road Services to become the first and
    largest provider of roadside assistance as a marketing tool for industries
    to increase sales and profit. It's no secret that consumers want more value
    and Auto Road Services has been the pioneer in offering roadside assistance
    programs to encourage consumers to purchase products and services from companies
    that offer it.</p>
