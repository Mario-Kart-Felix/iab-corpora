1972 AMC Hornet Sportabout Wagon For Sale
<br><i> Fully functional Classic - Modern and 40 years young!</i>
<P>
<b>HERE's THE STORY:</b>
<P>
This enthusiast bought this car in Glendale California in 1983.  It was a one-owner stock family car.  I had fallen in love with this model when I first saw a train load of them on an overpass in Detroit in 1971.
<P>
The love affair has lasted 29 years even while owning dozens of other vehicles.  Over the years I've owned just about every AMC model built.  It's been a great run.  Now it's time to let go.  This one has a 1987 Jeep Wrangler 4.2L 258cu.in. in-line six engine with about 60K on it.  RV Cam, Clifford Headers and duel exhaust.  Big 2bbl carb.  It runs and drives great.  The chassis milage is 168,000 California miles.
<P>
It's been restored a couple of times and needs it again.  But everything's there and more.  No mising pieces. After market AMC sunroof.  Jeep Eagle 8-way recliner power seats.  Eagle tail gate with defog, washer/wiper.  Class III hitch receiver.  The hood is the raised one from a Gremlin.  Factory AM/FM - and A/C that works when charged.  Power Steering, Power Breaks, Automatic.
Disk brakes on front.  Factory 14" steel wheels. Duel mirrors. 
Lots of extra parts for the future. There's even an after-market power window kit on the shelf. And the original space-saver spare with a fresh can of air.  There's under floor storage in the back as well.
<P>
The dash needs wiring but everything does work.  There's an additional Gremlin X Instrument Cluster with tack and switches ready to install.  It also has a Factory Ralley Guage Cluster under under the dash package tray.  The clock was rebuilt with a quartz winding. This is a fun, reliable, practical classic. 
<P>
Clear title, current tags, insured.  No smog needed.  $1,995. Delivery possible. Lake County California 707-994-4162
<P>
<u>BTW, there are all kinds of AMC Eagle Chassis parts here also.</U> 

<P><P><U><b>HISTORY</b></u>

<P>
The Sportabout was built from '70-'77 and through '87 as the Concord and 4x4 Eagle (AMC bought Jeep in 1970). American Motors came from the merger of Hudson and Nash which morphed into the Rambler and morphed again into the Hornet which morphed with Jeep to be the AWD Eagle. The 1954 Nash models were the first American automobiles to have a front-end, fully integrated heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning system marketed as "all-weather-eye". This Hornet carries the same trade mark on its in-dash control system.
