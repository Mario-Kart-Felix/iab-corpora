    <h1>Truck Accessories</h1>
    <p>At Auto Trim Design of Burlington, NC, we do more than just car accessories; we can also outfit trucks and SUVs with the best accessories available.  Whatever your purpose, weâll be sure to set you up with the best custom-fit accessories to reflect your style and needs.</p>
    <p>Not only that, but install what we sell so you donât have to worry about any of the hassle of figuring out how to install truck accessories.  Weâll do all the hard work and make sure you are satisfied.  Hereâs a look at our accessory offerings.</p>
    <h2>Running Boards &amp; Step Bars</h2>
    <p><img src="images/running-boards-1.jpg" alt="running-boards-1" width="200" height="258" class="floatpic-right"  style="width:200px; height: 258px;" />Running boards and step bars are meant to make it much easier to get into your car.  Done right, they can fit the style of your truck, SUV or van â and you â quite well.  Our running boards and step bars we offer come in the following different types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stainless Steel</strong> - Our stainless steel running boards and step bars are made of high-quality steel that will stand the test of time.  Sleek and classy, they are both practical and aesthetic in appearance.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Fiberglass - </strong>         Auto Trim Designâs fiberglass running boards are extremely strong and sturdy, and they lend themselves well to most truck designs.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Aluminum &amp; Molded</strong>         - If you want the sleekest type of running boards and step bars possible, our aluminum and molded running boards might be just what youâre after.  With a chrome look, they can be the perfect accents to any truck.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><img src="images/extang-platinum-tonneau-cover.jpg" alt="extang-platinum-tonneau-cover" width="200" height="183" class="floatpic-left"  style="width:200px; height: 183px;" />Tonneau Covers</h2>
    <p>Carry things in the back of your pickup truck often?  Perhaps a tonneau cover is just what you need.  Protect your cargo from the elements with either hard or soft tonneau covers.  We can help pick a tonneau cover that fits your truck design and protects your stuff from rain, snow, and ice.</p>
    <p>We carry several brands of hard tonneau covers that are weather resistant and will keep your items safe.  The brands we support include Undercover, Jason, Armor-Lid, and Roll-n-Lock.  Hard tonneau covers tend to do the best job of protecting items in the back of your truck from the elements.</p>
    <p>Soft tonneau covers are lighter and less expensive than hard tonneau covers.  They are ideal for those who want to cover the back of their pickup truck but donât need a hard cover to do the job.  Auto Trim Design carries Truxedo, Extang and Access.  These are all top quality brands of soft tonneau covers.</p>
    <h2><img src="images/pentruck_liner.jpg" alt="PENtruck_liner" width="200" height="143" class="floatpic-left"  style="width:200px; height: 143px;" />Bedliners</h2>
    <p>Carry a lot of things in the back of your truck, but you still want to protect the bed lining?  Then you probably need a bedliner.  We can help with that!  We carry both drop-in bed liners and mats/rugs.  Each of these is suitable for different purposes.</p>
    <p>Drop-in bedliners from brands such as Penda and Rugged Liner, have shock-absorbing ribs, are consistent in their thickness, and are extraordinarily durable.  Even chemicals that might spill are no match for the durability of drop-in bedliners!</p>
    <p>We can also supply you with mats and rugs for your truck bed lining needs.  Mats and rugs, such as those from Bedrug and LRV, although not as durable and protective as drop-in bedliners, are very cost-efficient and provide good protection for your truck.<img src="images/better-built-bed-rail.jpg" alt="better-built-bed-rail" width="200" height="200" class="floatpic-right"  style="width:200px; height: 200px;" /></p>
    <h2>Bed Rails</h2>
    <p>Bed rails that go on the sides of your cargo bed, protect the paint of your truck and provide more tie-down points to tie down cargo.  They also provide a very classy and elegant look to your truck bed!  We carry Putcoâ¢ and Better BuiltÂ® bed rails in chrome stainless steel.</p>
    <h2>Hitches</h2>
    <p>      Auto Trim Designâs pickup truck and SUV hitches are top-quality.  We back everything we sell, and our custom made and multi-fit hitches are no exception.  With strength, durability, and a professional look and feel, our valley tow, Putnam, and draw tile hitches are just what you need if youâre on the market for truck hitches.</p>
    <h2><img src="images/jason-camper.jpg" alt="jason-camper" width="250" height="181" class="floatpic-right"  style="width:250px; height: 181px;" />Camper Tops</h2>
    <p>When it comes to truck accessories, a camper top is an accessory that many people need.  For most people, our JasonÂ® fiberglass truck camper tops will be suitable.  Durable with a strong seal, Jason fiberglass camper tops are affordable and practical.  Make sure that what you carry in the back of your truck is protected well by getting a camper top for your truck.</p>
    <h2><img src="images/putco-grill.jpg" alt="putco-grill" width="200" height="133" class="floatpic-left"  style="width:200px; height: 133px;" />Grills</h2>
    <p>For people who want to add an extra flair of style to their trucks, we recommend Putco, Precision Grill, and Lund Truc aluminum grills for trucks.  These grills are top notch and suitable for all of your truck grill needs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><img src="images/deflectors.jpg" alt="deflectors" width="200" height="114" class="floatpic-right"  style="width:200px; height: 114px;" />Deflectors</h2>
    <p>Our Ventshade and Weathertech rain guard deflectors for trucks will snugly fit above your windows, protecting your windows from rain.  Do your truck windows often 	get so wet with rain that theyâre difficult to see through?  Sure, you can use your windshield wipers, but what about your windows without windshield wipers? 	Be safe.  Protect your field of vision while driving your truck with rain guard deflectors.</p>
    <p>While youâre at it, isnât it annoying when bugs splatter in your grill and on the hood of your truck?  Ventshade chrome and smoke bug shields can help with this.  Fitting right in with the look of your truck, bug shields will protect your paint job from those gross bugs splattering on the front of your truck.</p>
