					Every motorcycle enthusiast loves the freedom of being out on the road, but with this freedom comes some risk. It is more likely you will encounter some kind of emergency or problem than if you were riding in a car, since you have less protection around you and you are more exposed to the road and elements. However, motorcycle lovers need not fear, for if they prepare for the worst, you can relax your worries.				</div>

					The motorcycle helmet is a serious bit of gear that you wear over your head when you ride a motorcycle.

You will find more head accident injuries in states where helmets are not imperative.				</div>

					One of the most common mistakes new motorcycle owners tend to make is to underestimate the importance of proper equipment. Few things can help you in case of a crash and maximize your chances of survival, and having a good layer of protective clothing over your body is among the top of the list. That's why so many governments actually make it a requirement that anybody riding a motorcycle must wear certain types of protective wear.				</div>
