            original goal of the Electric Vehicle Project</b> was to convert a 
            car to electric and show the viability of electric vehicles (EVs) 
            as a clean, quite commute alternative. After the successful conversion 
            of our first car, an important new goal came to the forefront: to 
            make available the information we learned about converting a car to 
            electric and to be a resource for other interested parties wishing 
            to convert a car. The donation of the a MG Midget by Will Doolittle, 
            with the stipulation that the MG be converted to run on Electric power, 
            got the project rolling in 1992.<br>
            <br>
            <b> Since then the MG has been to many <a href="#06">EVents</a></b> 
            (as EV people call them). The first such EVent was Earth Day 1994 
            at Stanford University. After that we showed the car at the Palo Alto 
            Concours d'Elegance, and then the &quot;All Right Now&quot; Parade 
            to celebrate homecoming at Stanford and the Palo Alto Centennial. 
            At each event we hand out <a href="#03">general EV information</a> 
            and answer questions about our project specifically.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Our first resource customer</b> was Acterra's High 
            Schools Group, to whom a VW Rabbit had been donated. After unsuccessfully 
            trying to give the Rabbit to a high school auto shop class, Schools 
            Group members decided to convert it to electric.<br>
            <br>
            <b>We also developed &quot;<a href="mg_manual.html">The MG Users 
            Manual</a>&quot;</b> for the electric MG, complete with a Suppliers 
            Reference for EV parts and a Reference Books listing.<br>
            <br>
            A good source of information during our conversions has been the local 
            EV community here in Palo Alto. Otmar 
            Ebenhoech of EVCL and Bob Schneeveis have been invaluable in their 
            help and expertise. Local to the Bay Area but e-mail in scope is Bruce 
            Parmeter, an EV advocate willing to disseminate EV information. 
            The <a href="http://www.eaaev.org" target="_blank">Electric Auto Association</a>, 
            with chapters nationwide, and the <a href="http://www.madkatz.com/ev/evlist.html" target="_blank">EV 
            Discussion Group List</a> have also been good resources for our project. 
            The last reference comes from the <a href="http://eaaev.org/Info/index.html" target="_blank">EAA's 
            EV Information page</a>. This has other good EV references

            <br>
            <span class="GrnDk1115">Contrary to popular beliefs, <b>EVs are 97% 
            cleaner</b> then the internal combustion engine (ICE) car. This includes 
            the pollution that is generated at the electrical power plant. It 
            is much easier to clean up one central power plant than to keep all 
            the individual ICE cars tuned up and running cleanly. It is also easier 
            to retrofit power plants and update them to run cleaner still, than 
            retrofitting all the ICE cars (old and new) out on the road. And in 
            the future, as we switch over to renewable sources of energy (solar, 
            wind, geothermal, etc.), the EV will get even cleaner, unlike the 
            ICE car. Even clean alternate fuel (natural gas, propane, methanol) 
            cars produce oxides of nitrogen, a major component of smog. Over 90% 
            of the daily trips made in the U.S. are under 50 miles. This is within 
            the range (40 to 60 miles) of most EVs. <b>An EV is the perfect car 
            in urban areas</b> where smog is the worst and daily commutes are 
            short. Many families have two cars: one larger one for longer trips 
            and a smaller commute car for the ride to work. EVs can be the perfect 
            second car in this common situation.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Maintenance of an EV is much less difficult</b> than on an ICE 
            car. Most of what you have to do is check and add water to the batteries 
            once every month or so. If your car has sealed batteries, then you 
            don't even have to do this. You will have to check the brakes and 
            suspension a little more often if you have an EV that does not have 
            regenerative braking, where the force of slowing down the car is used 
            to charge the batteries. The main battery pack will have to be changed 
            every 3 to 4 years depending on your driving and on the kind of batteries.<br>
            <br>
            What about all these batteries? Lead acid batteries are 98% recyclable. 
            The lead is melted down and reused, the plastic case is shredded and 
            recycled and even the acid is naturalized and made into fertilizer.<br>
            <br>
            <b>California's revised mandate</b> says that 10% of all cars sold 
            in the state in 2003 must be zero emission vehicles. This did not happen, 
            but we did see hybrids leaping into the picture based on EV technology.  
            California is still leading the way with New York, Massachusetts and ten other eastern 
            states also considering California's curren CAFE standards to help reduce  
            green house gas emissions. So what are the big auto manufacturers 
            doing about this? They are fighting it as usual; as they have 
            fought against any regulation on the cars they make: seat belts, catalytic 
            converters, air bags, etc. Now, finally with gas over $4.00 per
            gallon the Big Three are realizing that the ICE (internal combustion engine)
            age is over.<br>
            <br>
            So where does this leave us? Converting a gas car to electric can 
            cost between $5,000 to $7,000 to do it yourself or $10,000 to 20,000 
            to have a conversion shop do it for you. If you compare this to the 
            price of a new car today, <b>EVs can be cost-competitive</b>. Is there 
            an EV in your future?</span></td>

            hp (60 hp max.) Prestolite series DC motor connected to the standard 
            transmission by an adapter plate. The motor is controlled by an Auburn 
            C600 motor controller powered by twelve 12 volt 30XHS Trojan deep 
            cycle lead acid batteries. The car is charged by a simple diode bridge 
            type of charger that has an adjustable auto shutoff. The 12 volt system 
            is run off of two small 6 volt gel cells that are charged from the
