<font class="title_auto_diesel">
      <strong>SIGNIFICANT POINTS ABOUT A DIESEL MECHANIC AND AUTO MECHANIC CAREER</strong>
      </font> 
      <ul>
<li>Automotive service technicians and mechanics must continually adapt to changing technology and repair techniques as vehicle components and systems become increasingly sophisticated.
<li>Formal automotive technician training is the best preparation for these challenging technology-based jobs.
<li>Opportunities should be very good for automotive service technicians and mechanics with diagnostic and problem-solving skills, knowledge of electronics and mathematics, and mechanical aptitude. 
      </ul>

<font class="title_auto_diesel"><strong>EMPLOYMENT  </strong></font>
<br><br>

Automotive service technicians and mechanics held about 773,000 jobs in 2006. Automotive repair and maintenance shops and automotive dealers employed the majority of these workers-29 percent each. In addition, automotive parts, accessories, and tire stores employed 7 percent of automotive service technicians. Others worked in gasoline stations; general merchandise stores; automotive equipment rental and leasing companies; Federal, State, and local governments; and other organizations. Almost 17 percent of service technicians were self-employed, more than twice the proportion for all installation, maintenance, and repair occupations.
<br><br>

<font class="title_auto_diesel"><strong>JOB OUTLOOK  </strong></font>
<br><br>
      The number of jobs for automotive service technicians and mechanics is projected to grow faster than average for all occupations over the next decade. Employment growth will create many new jobs, but total job openings will be significantly larger because many skilled technicians are expected to retire and will need to be replaced.<br><br> 

Employment change. Employment of automotive service technicians and mechanics is expected to increase 14 percent between 2006 and 2016, compared to 10 percent for all occupations. It will add a large number of new jobs, about 110,000, over the decade. Demand for technicians will grow as the number of vehicles in operation increases, reflecting continued growth in the driving age population and in the number of multi-car families. Growth in demand will be offset somewhat by continuing improvements in the quality and durability of automobiles, which will require less frequent service.<br><br> 

Employment growth will continue to be concentrated in automobile dealerships and independent automotive repair shops. Many new jobs also will be created in small retail operations that offer after-warranty repairs, such as oil changes, brake repair, air-conditioner service, and other minor repairs generally taking less than 4 hours to complete. Employment of automotive service technicians and mechanics in gasoline service stations will continue to decline, as fewer stations offer repair services.<br><br> 

Job prospects. In addition to openings from growth, many job openings will be created by the need to replace a growing number of retiring technicians. Job opportunities in this occupation are expected to be very good for those who complete high school or postsecondary automotive training programs and who earn ASE certification. Some employers report difficulty in finding workers with the right skills. People with good diagnostic and problem-solving abilities, and training in basic electronics and computer courses are expected to have the best opportunities. Those without formal automotive training are likely to face competition for entry-level jobs.<br><br> 

Most people who enter the occupation can expect steady work, even during downturns in the economy. Although car owners tend to postpone maintenance and repair on their vehicles when their budgets are strained, employers usually cut back on hiring new workers during economic downturns instead of letting experienced workers go. 
<br><br>


<font class="title_auto_diesel"><strong>EARNINGS</strong></font>
<br> 

<p>Median hourly wage-and-salary earnings of automotive service technicians and mechanics, including commission, were $16.24 in May 2006.  The middle 50 percent earned between $11.96 and $21.56 per hour.  The lowest 10 percent earned less than $9.17, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $27.22 per hour.  Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of service technicians were as follows:</p>

<p>Many experienced technicians employed by automobile dealers and independent repair shops receive a commission related to the labor cost charged to the customer.  Under this system, weekly earnings depend on the amount of work completed.  Employers frequently guarantee commissioned technicians a minimum weekly salary.</p>

<p>Automotive service technicians who are members of labor unions, such as the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, may enjoy more benefits than non-union workers do.</p><br>
