				 		<strong>Ever considered electric trucks?</strong> Imagine delivery vehicles that didn't require costly trips to the service station to refuel. Delivery vehicles that could run 24/7 without emissions, quietly and efficiently delivering your promises to your customers. Imagine electric trucks with class-leading payload, with swappable batteries to keep your business going around the clock, and at a price comparable to conventional delivery vehicles.
					</p><p>
						 Imagine no more. Designed in the UK, the Bluebird City Electric Truck from EV Innovations delivers on its promises. A 3.5 tonne GVW vehicle with a payload of up to 1.7 tonnes, the Bluebird City Electric Truck delivers low running costs, excellent around town performance, a range of body options and unbeatable environmental credentials.

						Designed by the team responsible for the latest Bluebird land speed record car, and produced by EV Innovations, the foremost electric vehicle design consultancy in the United Kingdom, the Bluebird City Electric Truck is the result of over ten years of UK based research and development. With test vehicles in use since 2006, we have refined and improved our vehicle to make it the most efficient on the market.
					</p><p>
						Unlike our competitors, we've designed our electric vehicle from the ground up, resulting in unbeatable economy and performance. The City is a no-compromise delivery vehicle that can be justified on its own merits, and not just because of its zero carbon dioxide emissions.
					</p><p>
						With the Bluebird City electric trucks, EV Innovations deliver the future today. High on environmental performance, low on running costs, we deliver a electric vehicle with class leading payload, great manoeuvrability and unbeatable economy, all backed up with a three year warranty as standard.
