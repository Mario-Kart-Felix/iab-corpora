Yes, they are expensive at first, but eventually they will pay off with the lack of gas bills that you will have to pay. They also emit much less pollutants than diesel engines do, so you will be helping your environment by investing in one.

					Not long ago, I was at one of the local coffee shops, and a very cool three wheeled hybrid came by and parked in front. Everyone was busy looking at it and it really caught my eye as well. While everyone was talking about the beautiful car, or was a motorcycle, I couldn't really tell, the owner was explaining to all of us that it was an ultra-efficient vehicle. Let's talk.				</div>

					HHO gas systems work on the principle of using electricity from your car's alternator to run an electric current through water that has been mixed with an electrolyte similar to salt. The electricity generated is able to break the bond between hydrogen and oxygen which are then released as gases.				</div>

				<div class="article-summary">
					There is an ongoing dispute between the US government and electric car manufacturers regarding potential safety concerns. The fact that electric vehicles of today tend not to make any noise up to 17 mph has prompted calls for legislation to pre-fit all electric vehicles with noise technology which will filter out at 17 mph. This may seem rather bizarre to those on the outside looking in but there are a number of aspects which need to be addressed.				</div>

				<div class="article-summary">
					Over the last few days there has been intense speculation that the US government would reduce or even cancel the successful electric vehicle financial initiative program. This, together with the direct investment made available by the government for electric vehicle manufacturers, has had a major impact on the US electric vehicle market even if it is still just a fraction of the traditional market at the moment. However, it seems that the US government is looking to commit around $2 billion towards transportation research to reduce the country's dependence upon petroleum.				</div>
