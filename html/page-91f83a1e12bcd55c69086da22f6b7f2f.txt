In the early 1900s, there were more electric vehicles than there were gasoline-powered cars. The vehicle picturedis a Rauch and Lang Electric Sedan, built around 1922.<IMG src="images/rauch+lang.gif" align=left width=236 height=156 hspace="8" vspace="8" alt="Rauch and Land"><BR CLEAR="right"><p>Gasoline back then was <B>very</B> expensive. It also was hardto start a gasoline engine; you had to turn and turn and turna crank in front of the car to get it to start. They did not havea key to start the car like we do today. Gasoline vehicles werealso noisy and put out lots of smoke. The cars either had no mufflers,or the mufflers didn't do a good job. So, electric vehicles were a BIG hit! At one timethere were 50,000 EVs on the roads and streets of the United States.<p>But EVs soon faded away like the horse-drawn carriage. Ways ofcheaply making gasoline were discovered. A new invention calledan electric starter was made. It started the car with a key insteadof a crank. A gasoline car could go much farther than an electricone. So, gasoline-powered vehicles soon became the main methodof transporting people.<p>Automobile companies are making cars cleaner and cleaner. Tencars built today produce the same amount of pollution that you'dget from just one car built 15 years ago. And oil companies arecreating cleaner fuels like a new gasoline called reformulatedgasoline. But EVs are back on the road.<p><BR CLEAR="left"><H3>Electric Vehicles...Already Here in California </H3><IMG src="images/2002_ford_ranger_ev.jpg" align=left wdith=173 height=108  hspace="8" vspace="5" alt="Ford Ranger - Electric"> California has always been a place for cars.Cars take people to work, to the grocery store, to school.Trucks carry all sorts of goods from farms and factories to ourstores. Our state would literally come to a stop without carsand trucks.<p>California has more than 23 million registered vehicles. And allthose vehicles' exhaust produces a large amount of air pollution.Cars, trucks and motorcycles cause the largest amount of air pollution - about 35 percent.<p>In 1990, the state agency that is responsible for protecting California'sair quality passed a rule to reduce the pollution from cars. The<A href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/">California Air Resources Board</A> (ARB)decided that beginning in 1998, two percent of all vehicles soldin California would have to have zero emissions. That would have meant thatabout 20,000 vehicles sold that year would have been electric vehicles.<p>In the mid-1990s, the ARB, however, changed its mind followinga huge lobbying effort by the auto companies.  ARB decided not tomandate the introduction of EVs, but to instead letautomobile manufacurers voluntarily sell Zero-EmissionVehicles (ZEVs) from 1998 to 2002. Then, starting in 2003, tenpercent, or one out of every ten cars sold, would have to bea zero-emission vehicle.  As the deadline approached, the agency changed the regulationeven further. The compromise allowed extremelylow-emission vehicles to get partial ZEV credits, but required thatauto companies only sell two percent pure-ZEVS.<p>Our vehicles also use a lot of fuel. <B>California's cars andtrucks burn 14.5 billion gallons of gasoline each year!</B> That's enough gasoline to fill a line of tanker trucks stretchedbumper to bumper from San Francisco to San Diego <B>AND BACK!</B><p>Nearly all of California's cars and trucks use only gasolineand diesel, both made from oil. California produces only halfof the oil it uses. The rest comes from Alaska and foreign sources. The United States,as a whole, imports more than one-half of the oil it uses from other countries-- mostly from the Middle East and South America. If there wereto be a disruption of oil or gasoline supplies, we'd have lotsof problems. So, having other types of fuels -- alternative fuels-- to power our trucks and cars will help California and our country.<p><H3>How Do Electric Vehicles Work? </H3><IMG src="images/ev1.jpg" align=right width=215 height=127 hspace="5" vspace="8" alt="EV1.jpg">Electric vehicles (like the <b>Ford Ranger Electric Vehicle</b> above on the left) don't burn gasoline in an engine. They useelectricity stored on the car in batteries. Sometimes, 12 or 24batteries, or more, are needed to power the car.Just like a remote-controlled, model electric car, EVs havean electric motor that turns the wheels and a battery to run thatmotor.<P>One of the first modern EVs was the General Motors Impact. GM changedits name and started selling the GM "EV1" in 1997. This sleek looking car even set a World Record of  more than 180 miles per hour!<p>The EV1 is very aerodynamic. This means that air slides aroundthe body of the car very easily. The less air resistance or drag,the less energy is needed to power the car at freeway speeds.<p>The EV1 is as aerodynamic as some jet fighter aircraft!<BR><BR clear=right><IMG src="images/impactcharge.jpg" align=left width=190 height=156 vspace="5" hspace="8"alt="Charging an Impact EV">To charge an EV's batteries, the car is usually plugged in at night. Inthe picture to the left, an Impact test vehicle is plugged intoa special charging unit attached to a house. The Impact is notyet available for sale. Some EVs can plug right into a regularelectrical wall outlet. Others need a larger outlet, like thekind that a stove or electric clothes dryer plug into.<p>Electricity, the same energy that lights your lamps and runs yourTV, is stored in batteries on an EV.<p>The batteries can be lead acid batteries, like the batteries youfind in our flashlight or in regular gasoline cars. Or they canbe ni-cad (nickel-cadmium) like the kind that run portable videorecorders or a portable video game player -- only much larger.<p>Better batteries that hold more energy and last longer are beingdeveloped. In 2001, by the time today's fifth graders are readyto drive, electric vehicles should be able to go 150 to 200 milesbefore recharging.<p><BR><H3>How far can an EV go? How much do they cost?</H3><IMG src="images/2002_ford_thinkcity_ev.jpg" align=right width=181 height=114 hspace="8" vspace="8" alt="Ford 'Th!nk' EV">Most EVs today, however, can only go about 100 milesbefore you need to plug them in and recharge their batteries.They are not like the Energizer Bunny<SUP>(tm)</SUP> that keeps on going,and going, and going.But, 50 to 100 miles is plenty for most people who only drivea short distance to and from work, to and from school, or to dosome shopping like the <b>Ford Th!nk Neighborhood Electric Vehicle</b> on the right.<p>Some EVs with special batteries can go a longer distance. The car on the rightis made by a company in Massachusetts called Solectria. It iscalled the &quot;Sunrise.&quot; In 1995, a Solectria Sunrise set a world record for going 238miles on one charge.<p>Electric vehicles are more expensive to buy than gasoline cars, but when more and more EVsare made, the price of EVs should drop to about the same as gasoline cars.<p><BR><H3>EVs Available Today </H3><IMG src="images/2002_toyota_rav4_ev.jpg" align=right width=181 height=107 hspace="8" vspace="8" alt="Toyota RAV4 EV">Some EVs, like the <B>Toyota RAV-4 EV</b> are made by major autocompanies.Other electric vehicles built today are made by small car companies,or by people who build them in their own garages as a hobby.Some people build cars from kits and make them look like gasolineroadsters or like sports cars.<br clear="right"><IMG src="images/wilde3.gif" align=left width=216 height=121 hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="Wilde EV"><br clear="right"> Other people convert regular cars into electric vehicles. Theypull out the motor and gas tank and put an electric motor andbatteries into the car. Sometimes, the batteries go into the trunkor even under the back seat...they go where ever there is room.<p>Beginning in 1999, nearly all of the major auto companies -- Ford, General Motors,Toyota, Chrysler and Honda offered at least one model electric car. That numbers has dropped in 2002, with many auto companies workingon hybrid vehices -- a combination of a small internal combustion engine and an electricmotor.<BR clear=left><p><H3>Other Vehicles are EVs, too!</H3><IMG src="images/yosemite.jpg" align=right width=215 height=154 vspace="5" alt="Yosemite EV Bus">There are other types of electric vehicles, too. Many cities uses electric-poweredbuses, trolleys, subways or light-rail. Even most trains are electric.Other places will use electric buses with batteries, becausethey don't want wires over the roads.<p>One of those places is Yosemite National Park in California wheretwo new electric buses started being used in September 1995. Thebuses are almost silent, so the buses don't disturb visitors tothe national park.<p>Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric buses.<br clear=right><BR><IMG src="images/zapbike.jpg" align=left width=200 height=132 alt="ZAP EV Bike" hspace=10>Other people areusing electric-powered bicycles. The picture on the left is anelectric-powered bicycle made by ZAP Power Systems of NorthernCalifornia. <p>The motor is mounted just above the rear wheel and under the seat.The bag that's hanging from the middle holds the battery.<p>The bike can go 20 miles per hour, and it can travel 20 milesbefore needing a recharge.<p>Most people use bicycles for exercise. Some people use bicyclesfor going to school or work. Having an electric bike means youcan get to work or school without sweating. For people who havedisabilities, an electric-powered bike might allow them freedomto be outdoors.<BR clear=left><p><BR><H3>What About Solar-Powered Cars? </H3>Unfortunately, electric cars will probably not be solar-powered.Solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, produce too littlepower. They are not practical to power a full-sized electriccar.<p><IMG src="images/calpoly.gif" align=right width=288 height=202 vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Cal Poly Solar CAR">Some colleges, however, race solar-powered cars. The picture on the right isthe solar car from California Polytechnic University in Pomona,California -- CalPoly Pomona for short.<P>The back of the car is covered with solar cells, but all thosesolar cells only produce enough power to run an electric hairdryer...about 1,500 watts.<P>That's not enough energy to run a heavy vehicle. The CalPoly Pomonasolar car is also very light, less than 400 pounds. It's not strongenough to be in traffic and protect a driver in an accident withanother car or truck. <P>The solar car is also rather uncomfortable. Students have to climb intothe car and almost lie down in it. It also doesn't turn cornersvery well.<P>Solar cars give students a chance to build a better car and towork on advanced ideas in automobile design, engineering and mechanics.Building cars allows them to dream about ways to make cars moreefficient and to use fuels other than gasoline.<P>In 1990, the U.S. Department of Energy by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) started sponsoring the <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/education/natjss.html" TARGET="spl_main">National Junior Solar Sprint</A> (JSS) for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. JSS student teams construct model solar-powered cars and race them in interscholastic competitions.<P>                     Who knows, maybe ONE DAY, a student just like yourself will inventa real solar car that we ALL can drive.<BR clear=right><P><BR><B>Read more on...</B><UL TYPE=disc><LI><A HREF="gasoline.html"><B>Gasoline</B></A>.<LI><A HREF="alcohols.html"><B>Alcohols</B> - ethanol and methanol</A>.<LI><A HREF="CNG.html"><B>Compressed natural gas (CNG)</B> - natural gas under high pressure</A>.<LI><!A HREF="electric.html"><B>Electricity</B> - stored in batteries</A>.<LI><A HREF="fuelcells.html"><B>Fuel Cell Vehicles</B> - zero-emission vehicles of the future?</A><LI><A HREF="hybrid.html"><B>Hybrid Vehicles</B> - using a couple of different energy sources or motors</A>.<LI><A HREF="hydrogen.html"><B>Hydrogen</B> - a very special type of gas</A>.<LI><A HREF="LNG.html"><B>Liquefied natural gas (LNG)</B> - natural gas that is very, very cold</A>.<LI><A HREF="LNG.html#LPG"><B>Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)</B> - hydrocarbon gases under low pressure</A>.<LI><A HREF="coal.html"><B>Liquids made from coal</B> - gasoline and diesel fuel that doesn't come from petroleum</A>.<LI><A HREF="biodiesel.html"><B>Biodiesel</B> - a lot like diesel fuel, but made from plant oil or animal fat</A>.<p> <p><LI><A HREF="http://www.driveclean.ca.gov" target="_blank"><B>Alternative Fuel Vehicles Available in California</B></A><LI><A HREF="fuels_safety.html"><B>Safety First with Motor Fuels</B></A> </UL><BR><hr><BR><H3>Sites With More Information About Electric and Alternative Fuel Cars</H3><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI><A href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/afvs/index.html">California Energy Commission - Alternative Fuel Vehicle Information</A> <br>	<LI><A href="http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~uhlips/NDC/ndc.html" target="_blank">Advanced Research Projects Agency - Electric &amp; Hybrid Vehicle Data Center</A><BR>	<LI><A HREF="http://www.afdc.nrel.gov" target="_blank">Alternative Fuels Data Center </A>(U.S. Dept of Energy Funded)<BR>	<LI><A href="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~aset/" target="_blank">American	Society of Engineering Technology</A><BR>	<LI><A HREF="http://www.calstart.org" target="_blank">CALSTART</A> <br>		<LI><A HREF="http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/differentroads/index.html" target="_blank"> Museum of Modern Art's Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century (July 22-September 21, 1999) </A> <br>	<LI><a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/links/afvs.html" target="_blank">Links to Dozens of Other Places on the Internet About Alternative Fuel Vehicles.</A> <P> </UL><CENTER><br><A HREF="index.html"><img src="images/solar_logo_small.gif" width=72 height=72 border=0><BR>Return to AFVs Main Page</A><P></CENTER></font></td></tr></table><!-- end nested table contains the main heading and content --><BR><BR><!-- start bottom links and date updated section --><table width="550"><tr><td>    <center>        <p> <font size="2" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">         | <a href="../index.html">EQ Homepage</a>          | <a href="../story/index.html">Energy Story</a>          | <a href="../projects/index.html">Science Projects</a>          | <a href="../library/index.html">Library</a>          | <a href="../games/index.html">Games</a> |           <BR>         | <a href="../news/index.html">News</a>          | <a href="../search.html">Find It</a>          | <a href="../links/index.html">Links</a>          | <a href="../about.html">About EQ</a>          | <a href="../privacy.html">Privacy Info</a>          | <a href="../contactus.html">Contact Us</a> | <BR>          </font>         <BR><BR>              <font size="2" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">            Page updated: June 3, 2002</font><BR>            <font size="1" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">            <font size="3">&#169</font> 2006 California Energy Commission.
