                                        OVERVIEW <br>
<br>
This is a review from an owner perspective. This is a car I carefully researched, chose to buy and have driven daily for a while. So you are getting some real feedback and not just the result of a quick walk around and a test drive.<br>
<br>
This is a review of the 9-3 2.0T sport sedan. Other models are the higher performance "Aero" model, the 2-door convertable 9-3, and the 2 door hatchback version of the 9-3 called the "Sportcombi". <br>
<br>
The 2.0T sport sedan is what I would call a &#147compact&#148 sports sedan rather than a &#147mid-sized&#148. It&#146s about the same size as a Cadillac CTS or BMW 3-series. I know many call these cars &#147mid-sized&#148 sedans but I view them as compact. They are comfortable inside but I would not call them &#147roomy&#148. Don&#146t get me wrong, these are not shoeboxes &#150 but they really fit 4 adults, not 5-6, and back seat can be a tight fit. Certainly from the driver viewpoint I do not feel cramped. You can see the balance Saab struck between size and proportion and safety and comfort and gas mileage. Quite a marvel really when you consider the choices they had to make and still have this come out as an impressive mix of sporty, practical, economical, and classy. Without killing one&#146s wallet. <br>
<br>
This model only comes in front wheel drive; and every Saab has a turbocharged engine. In this model the in-line 4 cylinder is both turbocharged and intercooled. More on it later in this review. There is a sportier version of the 9-3 called the &#147Aero&#148 that puts a 6-cylinder turbo under the hood compared to the 4 cylinder. It also has bigger/nicer wheels and a few extra bells and whistles but otherwise is the same car. The 9-3 is meant to be a mix of sporty and luxurious, entry level luxury for the &#147junior executive&#148 (not sure I like thinking of myself as a junior anything!). One thing to note about this car is that I find the fit and finish to be exceptional. Everything nicely aligned, doors close with a satisfyingly solid &#147clunk&#148, etc. And the interior is different in a nice way. A high tech, crisp, airplane-cockpit feel. I have always been intrigued by Saabs; from the cool blue-and-red Griffin badge to the center mounted ignition switch. The car is packed with safety features; it is rated as one of the safest cars on the road. It also has a few quirky things that I find annoying and not endearing and made me scratch my head. I will point out  those things in this review. But they are not substantial and don&#146t detract from this car&#146s overall appeal.<br>
<br>
FEATURES <br>
<br>
I am going to give you the gist of features that are standard on the 2.0T sport sedan with the few extras I happened to get that I think are fairly common. You can check the Saab web site for the latest and any small details I may have left out. I was surprised at the cool features that are packed into this car for the price: <br>
<br>
Highlights of standard features are: <br>
<br>
- 4 Cyl intercooled/turbo engine that generates 210 HP <br>
<br>
- 16&#148 painted aluminum alloy wheels <br>
<br>
- 4 wheel disc/ABS brakes <br>
<br>
- Standard traction control<br>
<br>
- Standard stability control (ESP; Electronic Stability Control)<br>
<br>
- Saab ReAxis suspension that is supposed to help the car handle better in turns at speed<br>
<br>
- standard is a 6 speed manual, but optional is a great 5-speed auto transmission that downshifts as you slow, and can be switched to manual (tiptronic type) mode<br>
<br>
- &#147H&#148 rated Pirelli all-season tires (130 MPH)<br>
<br>
- Full leather interior<br>
<br>
- power adjustable front driver seat<br>
<br>
- dual zone automatic climate control <br>
<br>
- cooled/chilled glove compartment (for keeping that can of Pepsi cold) standard<br>
<br>
- tilt/telescoping wheel <br>
<br>
- rear defog/heated mirrors<br>
<br>
- Electronic key / keyless access<br>
<br>
- Express down windows <br>
<br>
- 7 speaker 150W sound system with single CD changer and AM/FM is standard; mine has the 9 speaker 270W  Bose sound system upgrade with 6-CD and integrated XM radio <br>
<br>
- 6 airbags<br>
<br>
- Onstar system (which is excellent peace of mind, have used it before on other cars and now I would not want a car without it) is an option and is not standard; if you get it, you also get integrated cell phone<br>
<br>
- theft deterrent system <br>
<br>
- trip computer<br>
<br>
- rear fog light<br>
<br>
Some other options for the 9-3 include an optional navigation system (DVD based); but you cannot have XM radio and DVD navigation both together. This is one of the annoying things. You can get up to 17&#148 wheels (but not bigger); auto dimming mirror, integrated garage door openers, rear parking assist sensors, heated seats, power moonroof are also options. Front fog lights are optional and not standard. Selecting the &#147Aero&#148 model gives you some extras that are not even an option on a &#147regular&#148 0-3. Such as dual exhaust and auto dimming rear view mirror with integrated garage door opener.<br>
<br>
You can check the Saab website for more minute detail but this is the gist of it.<br>
<br>
EXTERIOR <br>
<br>
This car has very nice, smooth lines. But not so smooth that it looks wimpy. It definitely has an edge to it. Front air intakes and air dam hint at performance. It is low slung and looks aggressive but not in a flashy way. I am tempted to call it &#147nondescript&#148 but its not really as boring as that word would indicate. Its low key but still looks fast. You might compare it to a BMW 3-series, it has that kind of styling. Body colored door handles and moldings lend to the sporty image. The car sits low and is low slung. Rear end is nothing exciting but blends nicely with the style of the car overall. There are no exhaust pipes at all visible in the rear on the standard 9-3.<br>
<br>
Blue and red Saab griffin badge is on the front hood and trunk. Very nice! A direct replacement for the BMW badge in terms of placement if comparing this to a 3-series beamer.<br>
<br>
Trunk is VERY good sized inside, and the opening is easy access. A huge trunk is not a feature you would expect in this car but its got a lot of room. I was surpised. Can fit a couple of big suitcases in it.<br>
<br>
There is only a key hole on the driver&#146s door, not on any other door and none on the trunk either. The keyless entry system is for the trunk and the doors. There is a traditional key cleverly stored in the key fob just in case you need it. But you can&#146t start the car with it, it&#146s only for gaining entry. <br>
Antenna for radio/XM/Onstar is small rubber looking thing on the rear of the roof and looks high tech.<br>
<br>
Overall a very clean, classy look that is on the sporty side but you could easily glance over it in traffic and view it as nothing special. Its only on closer look that you start to appreciate that its a bit more of an upscale sport sedan.<br>
<br>
INTERIOR <br>
<br>
I think the interior is tasteful and has a certain understated luxury. Fit and finish is excellent. Okay, here is where the GM detractors (GM owns Saab now) usually jump in and complain about plastic and general interior quality. I don&#146t find the interior cheap looking; its very slick. The materials look good and suitable for a an upscale sedan. Nice mix of leather, wood accents, chrome, aluminum, etc. It looks very classy but not opulent. Certainly if you love dials and buttons and switches and a cockpit type of feel, you will love this interior. <br>
<br>
I got mine with the tan leather interior, and with the dark colored  wood and satin finish aluminum trim, it looks very classy. The dash is very well laid out, controls are easy to get to and intuitive. Nice soft green glow at night for the instruments and all is well lit. There is a feature where you can hit a button and turn off the lights in the main instrument cluster for all except the speedometer (supposedly to help you focus/remove distraction at night. Its called &#147night panel&#148.) I find it kind of silly. The few gauges on the side that are shut off are not really a distraction. I will never use this feature.<br>
<br>
The base sound system is okay with 7 speakers at 150W, but nothing exciting. Its modestly powered. The upgrade to Bose adds two subwoofers in the rear for a total of 9 speakers, and another 120W of power to a total of 270W. It sounds great. I highly recommend this upgrade - I have it in my car and it sounds fantastic. <br>
<br>
There is a jack handily placed in the front of the unit to plug in your ipod. And the CD player also reads MP3 formats. The radio/cd player has easy to use buttons and is fairly intuitive. However the green LED display is not to my liking. It looks outdated, like one of those green screen computer monitors from the 60's. Its okay I suppose; it is bright and easy to read. But I would have preferred the crisper display and more modern look of a backlit LCD. This is a radio/CD player unit that is used in a lot of GM cars. I wish Saab did not have to use it in this car.<br>
<br>
The voice command system works for the climate control and sound system, and also for the integrated phone (you can buy minutes from onstar or you can link the car&#146s integrated phone to an existing Verizon account if you have one, as an additional line and use your Verizon plan minutes). <br>
<br>
Steering wheel has redundant controls for the sound system, voice commands, integrated phone and car computer features. The wheel tilts and telescopes nicely for plenty of adjustability. <br>
<br>
Instrument cluster is analogue display, and looks very crisp and classy. There is a driver information system embedded in the cluster, to tell you about any issues that come up, and also show you info on the outside temp, current miles on the car, your fuel economy, etc. It is easy to read the display and easy to use the switch on the left of the steering column to scroll thru the different information items. <br>
<br>
At night, controls are lit in a pale green color. Auto climate control is easy to use and understand and works well. Simple controls if you want to manually set fan, AC, etc or you can leave it on automatic, which is what I do. Just tell it what temp you want and forget it. You also have rear window defrost and heated mirrors. Controls for heated seats are easy to use as well, with two settings for high/low heating. <br>
<br>
Seat controls are intuitive and work well; and front seats are VERY comfortable and supportive. This was a major selling point for me. Seats must be comfortable. Long trips are no problem in these seats. Side bolsters are decent for some spirited driving but not enough side support for any massive performance moves. If you want to take turns at 70 MPH get the Aero.<br>
<br>
View out of all the windows is good; I see no real blind spots. <br>
<br>
Rear seats are comfortable, but not designed for really big people. I mean you can sit two back there comfortably, but leg room can be a challenge for the taller folks. This is one area where the car is lacking &#150 the back seat roominess. You could squeeze 3 in the back seat but I would only do that for short trips. Head room is also going to be an issue for very tall people. In a nutshell, the back seat is suited for small to medium/average sized people. Bigger than that and it gets a bit pinched. <br>
<br>
At the back of the center console there is an AC/heater vent with controls that will allow back seat passengers to control air flow. <br>
<br>
There are two 12V power plugs, one in the front dash and one inside the center arm rest. <br>
<br>
Storage in the front is good. A very big glove box, pockets under the front of the front seats, a center storage console. Well thought out. The space in the center console is not huge. There is a storage pocket on each door as well, and leather pockets on the back of each front seat for more storage. <br>
<br>
There are two cup holders in the back and two in the front. One of the front cup holders is intergrated into the dashboard and pops open when you hit a button, and retracts back into the dash when you don't want it. It looks a little flimsy but actual holds up and works quite well.<br>
<br>
There is a pass-thru to the trunk, in the middle of the back seat. The back seats fold down for any further pass thru of stuff. <br>
<br>
Controls all are very well thought out, well laid out, and easy to use. Exception in terms of quality are the stalks on either side of the steering wheel for controlling lights and wipers. They are easy to use but feel very lightweight which can translate to a feeling of cheap. I often wonder at the decisions the engineers must make to balance the weight and feel of virtually everything in the car, vs. the need to keep the car as light as possible for better gas mileage and performance. Its often the lightweight materials that can feel "cheap" in a car. But the weight of every part is indeed a consideration I am sure.<br>
<br>
ENGINE and FUEL ECONOMY <br>
<br>
Standard in the 9-3 is a 2.0 liter, overhead cam, multi-port fuel injected in-line 4 cylinder turbo and intercooled engine rated at 210 HP. It is an advanced engine with a well proven turbo. Turbo lag is practically non-existant when you step on it. And when you step on it, it hums in a satisfying fashion. It runs smooth and quiet in normal driving but you can hear it spool up when you add power. It also has the advantage of being able to run on regular gas, although you can of course put premium for better performance. The window sticker says 22 mpg city and 30 highway. I have averaged 27 miles per gallon in a mix of around-town and highway driving. Not bad for a sporty sedan driven by me in a way that none would describe as conservative. ;-)<br>
All in all it&#146s a great little engine that has been tuned up and well matched to this car. <br>
<br>
DRIVING EXPERIENCE <br>
<br>
The car handles quite well; steering is nimble and when driving it hard it feels solid.<br>
<br>
The FWD has minimal under steer when you step on it; the typical bane of FWD cars. Saab seems to have figured out how to eliminate most of that. It feels very sure footed, and &#147quick&#148. It takes off and zips around with ease. Feels very quick off the line. I have not timed it and I don&#146t care to. For me, it feels quick and is fun to drive and that is all I need to know. In reality its probably 7-8 seconds for 0-60MPH, But its quick enough to zip out in traffic and do passing at highway speeds with no problem. Its quite different from how a rear wheel drive would feel. It seems to leap when you step on it &#150 like a horse eager to run. Steering is precise. No verdict yet on winter driving, will update this when I have some real experience there.<br>
<br>
During fast turns it holds well and stays tight. Saab have added special proprietary braking and suspension features to allow for better performance in general when taking turns aggressively. The difference is duly noted; it is nimble in the twisties. Is it as good as a BMW 3-series in this regard? If its not, its only by a hair. Its got to be pretty darned close. I have driven both as I did my decision process and I did not notice a ton of difference. I think there is a psychological factor when one gets behind he wheel of a BMW where one's brain is automatically giving the edge to BMW.<br>
<br>
The ride is smooth but not mushy like some comfort tuned sendan suspensions. It&#146s a sporty feel where you can feel the road but its not harsh. Even though the Aero model is supposed to have the better performance suspension, the base 9-3 is clearly not just built for smooth ride - its sort of a middle ground of sport and comfort tuning. I like what Saab have done, they made it fun and maneuverable and you never feel like you are losing control.<br>
<br>
Braking is also excellent. Very smooth and sure. <br>
<br>
Ride is subdued but not dead silent. Some wind noise at highway speed but its not intrusive. Some road noise from the tires. You feel connected to the road in this car, its not the muted soft ride you may find in sedans made just for comfort.<br>
<br>
The car has a stability control system to help you during dangerous turns where the car might otherwise go out of control. <br>
<br>
Should you go out and get the Aero with the 6 cylinder engine? Its up to you. The 4 cyl is plenty quick. If you seek bragging rights then maybe go for the 6.  I don&#146t think the difference in feel when driving is that substantial in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Note that in 2008 I hear an all-wheel drive option may be added to the Saab lineup. This would be a nice improvement but is sure to add weight (and thus lower fuel economy) and will likely add a few thousand to the price.<br>
<br>
SAFETY <br>
<br>
All in all this car has a ton of safety features built into it. As previously mentioned, there are air bags all over the place in this car. Front/side/curtain airbags, airbags in the front and back. It is built as a &#147safety cage&#148 for a collision. The ESP stability control and traction control (which both operate at all speeds) are safety features, as are the ABS brakes that have power assist to give more braking under emergency situations. NOTE: brake pedal can feel a little "mooshy" at low speeds. I actually had the dealer check it, and was told with confidence that this is normal; the braking system draws power from the engine and at higher speeds more power is diverted. Its actually a fascinating system that the mechanic patiently described to me in detail.<br>
<br>
There are ample connections for child seats. The front passenger seat has a sensor so that if a small person or child sits in the front seat, the system turns off the passenger front air bag (which could kill a child). Kids under 13 should really sit in the back, regardless. Also, the window controls are designed so that you have to reach underneath the switch and pull upward, to raise the window. This prevents a kid from stepping on the button with a head out the window and closing the window on them.<br>
 <br>
Saab also has exclusive active head restraints in the front seat that move forward in a collision to better support your neck.<br>
  <br>
Onstar features monitoring of systems and notification of emergency services if an airbag deploys; and you are never more than a button push away from someone on the line ready to help you.<br>
<br>
NIFTY EXTRAS<br>
<br>
Roadside assistance is offered free for 5 years/100,000 miles on the car. <br>
Normal maintenance service (oil changes, rotate tires) is free for 3 years/36,000 miles<br>
<br>
MY LIST OF ANNOYANCES<br>
<br>
Owners manual says that driving through water more than 7 inches deep could allow water to be sucked into the engine and ruin it. Yikes! In a heavy summer rain gotta watch puddles and standing water that can be deceptive. 7 inches is not much! I wonder if a lot of other cars have this potential issue but its not pointed out as clearly as Saab points it out.<br>
<br>
Door locks: they do not automatically lock when you put the car in drive, etc. Nor do they unlock when you put it in park or pull on an internal door handle. The doors don't unlock in any way other than you physically unlocking them manually or by hitting the button on the door or key fob. If you are used to any kind of convenience on the door locks, you need to train yourself to be very involved in locking and unlocking again. Again, I would suspect that this is a Saab design decision where they are thinking that you should be in charge of when your car is locked/unlocked. I can see that side of it.<br>
<br>
Daytime running lights are the full headlights and the dash lights seem to be on all the time as well. From what I have seen there is no way to turn them off. When daytime running lights are on, and it gets dark, its just like you have the headlights on. Except that you can&#146t turn on your high beams; for that you have to move the switch to the regular &#147headlights on&#148 position, then high beams can be activated. This is annoying. If you are going to have the running lights be full lights, and keep the dash lit as well and full outside lighting as well, why not go ahead and make the high beams functional as well on that setting? I don&#146t get it. <br>
<br>
Why have a setting for daytime lights that is basically turning your headlights and dash lights on as if it were night time? Here I would prefer that a sun sensor in the dash would turn off at least the dashboard instrument lights when it senses daytime brightness. <br>
<br>
There is already a sun sensor on the dash (manual says it is used mainly as one of several sensors for the climate control system). And what is the difference between the daytime running lights and the full headlights setting (aside from ability to use high beams?). This day and age, in a car like this I am expecting auto-on headlights and dashlights via a sensor. As far as I can tell, the headlights, running lights, license plate light, are on all the time no matter where you set the headlights switch and no matter how bright it is outside. <br>
<br>
There must be something I am missing here. Okay, the other side of this coin may again be Saab deciding that all lights on, all the time (even in broad daylight), is safer. It probably is. Having your running lights in the rear on all the time is sure to help notify cars driving behind you that you are there. I just hate burning bulbs in daytime! Maybe because my Dad grew up in the depression and was always telling us to turn off lights and not waste energy. Okay, enough on this point as I am even starting to annoy myself with my obsession about this issue!<br>
<br>
Volume on the Onstar (which is also an integrated phone) is low. You really have to crank up the sound to hear it. When you turn off the onstar call/phone, your sound system is going to be on high volume and can blast your ears.<br>
<br>
Seat belt reminder chime is VERY loud and annoying. I guess its intended to be so that you put your seatbelts on. I have read that your seatbelts are the single most important safety feature for you to use. So, I guess I should not complain. It does drive one to put the darn seat belts on. That chime is relentless!<br>
<br>
Turn signal clicking sound is also very loud. Again, I would presume this is to avoid you leaving it on and forgetting it?<br>
<br>
PRICING <br>
<br>
The sticker base price for a standard 9-3 base model for 2007 is around $26,000. Mine had the moonroof, heated seats/headlight washers, upgraded bose sound system and Onstar, pushing the price to just under $32,000. As I bought at model year end (as I usually do to get the savings) there was $4,000 cash back from Saab. And I was able to get further price concessions since the dealer was eager to move out the 2007's. Destination charge is just over $700. Considering the leather seating, upgraded sound, moonroof, and all the other features in this car, a price of around $28k with the cash back alone is not bad at all. Very competitive. I was able to get it for under $25k.<br>
<br>
WARRANTY <br>
<br>
5 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain. Very good. <br>
<br>
CONCLUSION <br>
<br>
I love this car. Its quick, loaded with cool features, takes regular gas and gets decent mileage. I think its on a par with a other small sport sedans from makers such as Audi, BMW, and Cadillac, and has the edge as it is better for the money. The fit and finish is great, and it&#146s got that unique styling edge that Saab has been known for. It is a blast to drive, and it's one of the safest cars on the highway. Throw in the 5 year/100,000 mile warranty and free roadside assistance, and the free maintenance and you have one sweet deal.<br>
<br>
UPDATE 8-15-08: I am getting average gas mileage of 28.3 miles overall. This is with a balanced mix of highway and around town driving. I am very pleased. In terms of winter driving, this car is VERY good in the snow. Part of that is the front wheel drive, and part of it is the sophisticated electronics for stability and handling assist that Saab has put into this car. I have driven through some pretty bad, snow covered roads and it did great. I expected it to do okay, but was pleasantly surprised that it was better than I thought. Braking is EXCELLENT. I have had two emergency stops where I was sure I was going to have an accident but the Saab brakes saved me. I have had no mechanical issues with the car so far. Very pleased with my choice.
