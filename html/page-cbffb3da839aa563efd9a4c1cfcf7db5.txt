<div id="welcome">Welcome to the Electric Car Weblog.  In addition to links, news, and tips about electric cars and other forms of alternative transportation we are publishing an on-line diary of our current EV project.  Started in August 2005 the chronicle follows the conversion of a gas powered Ford Probe into an <a href="http://www.evconvert.com/eve/">Electric Car</a>.<br /><br />
You will find articles organized by categories, along with recent comments, along the right hand column of the website. If you are just getting started with the idea of converting a gas car to electric be sure to check out <a href="http://www.evconvert.com/article/your-first-electric-car">Your First Electric Car<br /><br /> Welcome and enjoy!<br /> &nbsp; -Jerry</div>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.evconvert.com/eve/electric-car-motors">Electric Car&#160;Motors</a> &#183; <span class="date">25 October 05</span></h3>

   	<p><img src="http://jerryrig.com/convert/images/motor.gif" width="179" height="121" style="border:none;" alt="ADC electric car motor" class="photoright" /></p>

	<p>I realized the other day that some folks might be reading this EV conversion without having read the first one.  One day I pop out the gas engine and a few days later a fully attached and matched electric motor is in place&#8230;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;<em>Hey, where&#8217;d that come from?</em>&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Let&#8217;s talk EV motors&#8230;</p>

	<p>Back when folks first started putting together their own electric cars they didn&#8217;t have many economical choices in motors.  Often the first EVs used surplus aircraft starter-generators as a motor.<sup>1</sup></p>

	<p>Aircraft starter/generators were most likely used because you could find them as surplus relatively cheap and they had enough power to move a car.  The EVs weren&#8217;t high performance, but could easily make it from point A to point B.</p>

	<p>Soon electric car enthusiasts started using higher power motors and controllers, like John Wayland&#8217;s Blue Meanie<sup>2</sup>, a 1972 Datsun 1200 which started off as a souped up aircraft starter based EV and soon moved up to a 9&#8221; Advanced DC motor with Curtis controller.</p>

	<p>The days of plodding electric cars were numbered.</p>

	<p>Most folks familiar with gas engines are taken back by what they perceive as the low horsepower rating in an EV.  Here&#8217;s an explanation from Austinev.org<sup>3</sup>:</p>



	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;Electric cars are driven by large electric motors usually rated between 3.5  and 28 horsepower.  For those accustomed to gas engines, this may not seem like much power, but the rating systems used for gas engines and electric motors are so different that the numbering system is almost meaningless.  Gas engines are rated at their peak hp, electric motors are rated at their continuous hp.  The peak hp of an electric motor is usually 8 to 10 times its continuous rating.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The motor installed in Eve is an Advanced DC FB1-4001<sup>4</sup>.  This is a 9&#8221; diameter, 140lb series wound DC motor.  I purchased is back in 1995 for our first EV and, as long as we don&#8217;t abuse it, the motor should last for decades.  The one part that wears out, commutator brushes, typically last 80,000 miles and are pretty easy to replace.</p>

	<p>On the first EV I failed to tighten one of the motor-transmission adaptor set screws and over a period of five years the adaptor worked its way back into the motor faceplate and wore away some of the metal.  In the process it damaged the bearing.  I found a local electric motor shop to replace it for $100, including parts and labor.</p>

	<p><img src="http://jerryrig.com/convert/images/mtradapt.gif" width="397" height="225" style="border:none;" class="photocenter" alt="motor adaptor breakout" /></p>

	<p>The hand drawing shows how the motor mates to the transmission.  You&#8217;ll find more details on our Mazda 626 motor and adaptor page<sup>5</sup>.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s a much larger selection of motors these days for all sizes of vehicles and performance needs.  Most EVs use series wound motors<sup>6</sup>, but you can also pick up permanent magnet and AC motors, even experimental wheel hub motors<sup>7</sup>.</p>

Hey, I&#8217;ve read the older site numerous times, and just found this new site, didn&#8217;t realize you were a fellow New Hampshireite (I live in MA now though, shh). I&#8217;ve been thinking about building an electric car for quite some time, but haven&#8217;t had the extra resources to buy a mess of batteries, or an extra car.

Hey this is cool I have been following some ev things.One Question when you put the electric motor in do you keep the torque  convertor in it&#8217;s place?The drawing never seams to show that.  Great job

</li>
	<li><small>&#8212; <a href="http://evconvert.com/">Jerry Halstead</a> &#160;&#160; Dec 26, 2005 14:29 PM &#160;&#160; <a href="http://www.evconvert.com/eve/electric-car-motors#c000256" id="c000256">#</a></small>
<br />
Hi Carl,<br />
<br />
I haven&#8217;t had to deal with a torque converter since my EVs are both manual transmission.  If you were to use an automatic (i.e. w/torque converter) then I suspect you&#8217;ll have to keep it and/or make other modifications to keep the auto trans happy.<br />
<br />
Since I don&#8217;t even use the clutch I&#8217;ve also skipped out on using the flywheel.  There&#8217;s a number of thoughts on this and approaches, all depends on the type of vehicle and driving you&#8217;ll be doing.

<p>On your first EV did you test your controller disconnected from the motor using lightbulbs etc., like it shows in the manual?  It shows using 10 X 12VDC lights in series to get the 120VDC load.  Press the accelerator and watch the bulbs get brighter etc.  Would a 120VAC light bulb work the same way or is there a difference between AC and DC bulbs?  I would just try it with the motor, but I&#8217;m just a little scared of turning on the ignition and crashing backwards through the overhead door.</p>

<p>Manual?  Instructions?  &#8221;:^)</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t recall the lightbulb suggestion.  First off I hooked a single battery right to the motor, with wheels off the ground, to watch the motor spin the tranny/wheels.</p>

	<p>Then I hooked up the controller, batteries, etc.. and took about a dozen voltage readings from all over a number of times (check, recheck, check the recheck) and then operated the potbox by hand so I could watch things and be ready to yank cables.</p>

	<p>All that to make sure it spun the right way, sounded ok, nothing got hot, and so forth.  Final smoke test was of course getting behind the wheel and trying it out.  Tense!</p>

	<p>The lightbulb idea is pretty good though.  You might want to use some high wattage flood lights.  A lightbulb is nothing more than a resistor that happens to put out some light along with the heat.  And like a resistor it doesn&#8217;t care about AC vs DC.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve heard of folks using big floodlights as a load for battery testing.  Here&#8217;s one such <a href="http://www.cam.org/~burt/circuits/batt-cap.html">circuit</a></p>

<p>I am new at this and have an idea about a new EV that doesn&#8217;t need to be recharged, Gas engine assist, a million batteries, or explosive Hydro gas fuel.  What i need to know is if the electric motors you speak of in these articles are they variable speed, or are they controlled, like a throttle on an electric train?  Is that throttle some sort of POT or some sort of computer connectted to the gas pedal?  Finally according to the article above, if I wanted a 400 hp engine, I would need a 40 hp motor?</p>

<p>Jer,</p>
  Eventually I will be able to place this engine in a train engine.  It is ratio oriented, i.e. you can use the same design, just larger versions.  I have been running my alarm clock radio for ten years on a version of this engine that is no bigger than a VHS tape.  It wakes me every morning and has never stopped putting out power.  The 400 hp I stated earlier refers to the gasoline engine equivalent HP.  For instance, my LeBaron has a 2.2 Turbo or 325 hp engine.  According to your article, That means the hp of the electric equivalent should be around 33 hp, correct?

<p>If a motor is listed as 144 volts, does it always run at that voltage or can it vary?  Basically I am wondering if its possible to use the motor you have, for instance, with a higher battery set voltage, like 192 V.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>

	<p>Sorry about the delayed response.  Usually the motor will have a chart which shows the typical range and power curve(s).  Here&#8217;s a good motor page over at <a href="http://www.electroauto.com/catalog/dcmotors.shtml">Electro Automotive</a> which shows the range for two DC motors (96-120vdc and 96-144vdc) along with sample test data.</p>

	<p>I can&#8217;t really tell you how well they&#8217;ll do pushed far outside of their published specs.  Most likely if you are running at higher voltages you run the risk of arcing across the commutator pads.</p>

	<p>Warp makes motors rated for higher voltages, like the <a href="http://www.electricvehiclesusa.com/product_p/mo-00-08311.htm">Warp 9</a> which goes up to 192vdc.</p>

	<p>Take that number with a grain of salt.  My 144vdc EV was really closer to 160vdc when fully charged, but that is what is leaving the batteries and heading to the controller.  The controller is going to chop/modulate the  power and what the motor sees will be quite different.</p>

	<p>Someone needs to start checking on these comments, they are getting out of hand</p>

	<p>No you can&#8217;t use the generator. if anything, it is rated for 1600 watts. That is 1.6KW, the motors used for EV are at the smallest about 16KW, and with ~24KW being the norm. Think about it, its being driven by a oversized go-kart motor, if the gas motor driving can&#8217;t move a car by itself efficiently, the generator wont do it either. and you would need AC voltage to move it, good luck with that.</p>

	<p>I took a quick look at the Rediline website (dub dub dub rediline.com) and It would appear to me that you could take the DC motor out of it and use it (as you asked) as a drive motor.  Given its original duty, I would say that it may be more suited to a continuous speed application such as an AC or PS pump drive.  You really need to find out what type of motor it is ie. series, shunt, or Permanent magnet.  A motor rewinder could probably tell you straight off which it is.</p>

	<p>Given that it turns out to be suitable for your needs (you didn&#8217;t say what it was for) you will probably find that it rates out at a bit higher than 1.6kW as it wouldn&#8217;t have the AC generator losses.  Is it a 12V or 24V unit?</p>

	<p>Hi Dave,</p>

	<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.kellycontroller.com/mot/Brushed-Motor-Speed_Controller.html">Kelly Controller</a></p>

	<p>They have controllers designed for PM motors and also offer regeneration which a standard series controller won&#8217;t give you. I have purchased one and should have it on the road shortly.</p>

	<p>OK,<br />
I know I&#8217;m bouncing around here with EV conversions, <span class="caps">GEM</span> cars and all the rest.  This is all new to me but I think I&#8217;m getting my head straight.  I&#8217;m back to converting the 94 Ford Probe.  That EV calculator is a great tool.  It only had a 93 Probe listed.  Can I convert a 94 Probe with an auto trans and would the setup be pretty much the same? Anyone got any suggestions?</p>

	<p>A lot of people seem to be thinking you need a DC motor to run a car. Try looking into using a AC motor ,batteries and a AC to DC conversion system.Also the braking system can use a DC motor at each wheel to slow the car down and at the same time this can generate electricity to help recharge the batteries. Look at how Teslamotors.com put thier system together. Good luck</p>

	<p>Hi Alan, <br />
Most of us are using a DC motor and controller because it&#8217;s less expensive than an AC one. You can get better efficiency with an AC motor and brake regeneration is easier to set up and more effective.<br />
Everything AC is much more expensive. I suppose it depends on your available funds. I think most people go for more expensive batteries before an AC system because it gives more bang per buck. Batteries are usually the limiting factor in an EV.</p>

	<p>Hi Rick</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t think you need to worry about heat with lead acid batteries unless you are in a very hot climate.<br />
If you are using the non-sealed flooded type of lead acid battery, then make sure you vent the gases away with something like 12V computer fans. They can produce an explosive concentration of hydrogen under a heavy charge. Good Luck!</p>

	<p>I am new at this and was also thinking of the generator/elecectric motor conversion. Honda (http://mayberrys.com/honda/generator/html/maingenerator.htm) makes one of the most fuel efficient and quiet generators on the market. They have ac/dc outputs&#8230;.so why not use an AC motor? If there is not enough output from the built in converter, then perhaps a larger converter can be used in it&#8217;s place? (http://www.voltageconverters.com/itemdesc.asp?ic=PW6000-12) This one puts out 12000 watts @ peak.</p>

	<p>If one generator does not work, Honda&#8217;s can be piggy backed to run together. At 135lbs ea., that is still lighter than a motor, transmission and a 12-20 gal gas tank.</p>

	<p>(The EU3000is &#8211; Super quiet generator with 3000 Watts at Maximum output. 135 lbs. with Eco-Throttle &amp; Optional Parallel Operation Connection Cable. Can operate 20 hours on less than 3.5 gallons of gasoline! Our most popular model for Recreational Vehicle usage. Connect (2) generators and double the wattage! (with optional parallel connection cable))</p>

	<p>Any suggestions?</p>

	<p>Thanks</p>

<br />
	<p>My setup is using a 11kw DC motor. The 11kw is a constant rating and the peak could be anywhere as high as 44kw when accelerating. At 3kw per generator you would need somewhere between 3 &#8211; 10 units depending on their actual peak output to get the same result. That&#8217;s why Hybrids have batteries as well as a generator to cope with the initial acceleration etc and match the generator to the cursing requirements rather than the peak. </p>

	<p>At least that’s how I understand it anyway.</p>

	<p>Is your goal to use more gas to drive that huge vehicle?</p>

I have a lot of mechanical knowledge and skills, but  i would like to ask a question. I have decided to convert a honda civic del sol, and from my research i want to put an AC motor and was wondering what type of (inexpensive) battery i should use to have a distance of 80 miles or more in a single charge?</p>

	<p>Also how many kw the AC motor should have for the same purpose, and what brand you recommend?</p>

	<p>Hi guys,</p>

	<p>Kenny,<br />
Read the gas powered EV link above and substitute diesel for gas generator. Diesel may add a bit of efficiency but you face all of the same issues, plus the fact that the fuel needs to be pre-warmed in the winter.</p>

	<p>Andre, <br />
I don&#8217;t think you can use the words &#8220;AC&#8221; and &#8220;inexpensive&#8221; in the same paragraph (grin). If you are going to be spending over $10k on AC components, why cheap out on the batteries?  AC may give you a slight be more range but not enough to offset the higher costs. I am only aware of a few AC systems/dealers and have no direct experience and can&#8217;t make any recommendations. </p>

	<p>John:<br />
Not sure what you are getting at there. You aren&#8217;t suggesting that you could charge the batteries while driving, now are you?

<br />
	<p>Just an idea not sure if it will work, my idea is to weld a very large sprocket to the inside of each rim on the back drive wheel then maybe run a small drive shaft with small sprocket to make shaft run as fast as you can, then drive maybe 8 alternators could line the shaft, those could charge the batteries as you drive, and if that&#8217;s not enough maybe add two wind turbines with maybe squirrel cage fan under hood because you push air, might as well use it for something.</p>

	<p>Scott,</p>

	<p>1/4 of a gallon per hour doing what?  Not pushing a 3,000 pound vehicle, or 4,200 lbs considering the generator itself weighs over 1,200 lbs. A diesel gen isn&#8217;t going to be more efficient than using a diesel engine to power the car directly: remember, each time you convert energy (diesel to  motion, motion to electric, electric to wheels) you lose some of it.</p>

	<p>I have a question about transmissions in a converted EV. I have noticed that many of the conversions state to keep the trans and pin it into one gear. Why not remove the trans all together and attach directly to the drive axle? This would save weight and the gear ratio could be changed in the driveline if needed.</p>

	<p>Hi Eugen, great to hear from you! Not quite sure what you mean: too many part/price choices or something else?</p>

	<p>Jason, if you have an axle with the right ratio it might work. You have to remember that a DC motor will have a maximum <span class="caps">RPM</span>, typically due to the brushes/commutator.  I think the main reason folks go with a tranny is that it is already there and a known entity.</p>

	<p>Great job on answering the questions that should be answered!<br />
I&#8217;ve got a 2004 Denali. I&#8217;ve already relegated it to about 15-20 miles a day, so I&#8217;m considering the conversion to use the guzzler as a commuter.<br />
Cost not being my main factor, I&#8217;m concerned about the capability of using the existing systems already in place. (i.e. <span class="caps">GPS</span>, Speedo, Gauges, Computer issues, etc.)<br />
I realize that this is not the ideal conversion, but I really like the luxury and would rather convert something usable for 4 adults, if only for going to dinner in town.<br />
Has anybody seen any calculators for a vehicle of this size and/or had any experience with existing electronics on newer vehicles?<br />
I&#8217;ve seen a couple of motor kits that should work at around 30KW (Rated, not Max) but I would like to hear more about the potential issues. I&#8217;ve already figured (approximately, until I settle on the motor) the other needs. (i.e Batteries, Controller, Mounting Space, etc.)</p>

	<p>Thanks, in advance.</p>

	<p>Well, let me say, it&#8217;s good that cost isn&#8217;t your main factor!  &#8220;:^)</p>

	<p>Get a nice big 9&#8221; <span class="caps">ADC</span> motor (or two!), a Zilla, and splurge for the latest Lithiums. That ought to get you more power (in exchange for more money) to haul the large vehicle around. </p>

	<p>As for saving all of the gadgets: no problem, they all run off of 12vdc and shouldn&#8217;t notice the difference. Some gauges aren&#8217;t going to make the cut, notably: temperature and gas. But you can usually rig something up for a Tach, the speedo is typically coming off of the tranny.</p>

	<p>Feed power into the tranny and your <span class="caps">AWD</span> will work. Of course being automatic you&#8217;ll have to rig up the EV motor to idle most of the time to keep the hydraulics pumped.</p>

	<p>But, as I&#8217;ve said a zillions times:  converting an inefficient gas guzzler to electric just gets you an inefficient electricity guzzler. Just doesn&#8217;t seem worth it. Instead, buy a little sports car (preferably with a blown engine) and convert it. Use that to zip around town and use the Denali when you just gotta have the space/luxury/cup-holders/long distance driving.</p>

	<p>When you push the clutch in a gas engine car or truck you are allowing the transmission to go into free spin.  when you let off of the accelerator pedal in an EV the motor and transmission both go into free spin unlike a gas engine which stays moving at all times.  it would be more like pushing the clutch halfway down in a gas engine car and shifting into the next gear but will work. if you wait about 2 seconds after you let off of the accelerator in an EV then it will be fine when you shift gears.</p>

	<p>Personally i prefer to keep the clutch because it reminds me of driving my old camaro 5 speed.</p>

I learned to drive in a farm truck with a worn out transmission, and you <span class="caps">HAD</span> to use the engine to match up the gear speeds, so I know how to drive without a clutch.  <span class="caps">BUT</span> &#8211; the syncros in these new trannys do not like to be used that way, I am not sure why.  If you have a very quick tach, you can do it, with some practice.<br />
I just keep my E-car in second gear and leave it there.  The motor has enough torque to pull easily from a stop, and is efficient at high <span class="caps">RPM</span>s so you don&#8217;t need to upshift.</p>

	<p>You would need to match the output torque too both drive shafts.<br />
I once pulled out both front drive axel shafts from a 4&#215;4 Subaru wagon (keeping the CV joints attached to transmission/outer hubs) then drove it around in 4High as a rear wheel drive.<br />
Recently I’ve seen the use of an electric motor in line with the rear drive shaft on a Chevy Suburban for better city <span class="caps">MPG</span>. I would think you could use such a setup with better results.</p>

From my job I am able to obtain A/C motors for company price and am looking for 25-30hp range 15-21kw. Is there any reason why I couldn&#8217;t run my system voltage at 220V? One difference I see in the motors are the <span class="caps">RPM</span> at 60Hz is 3600rpm versus the AC24 offered at electroauto.com which is 12,000&#8230; Would this be an issue if I retain the manual transmission?

	<p>Hasn&#8217;t anyone thought of using a separate generator for a power source powered by another lower voltage using electric motor? </p>

	<p>I mean I suppose it would matter what kind of motor you&#8217;re using and the voltage required. But like the motor mechanics, why not use a motor for the drive train, then a separate motor to drive the generator underneath the hood, would be the same weight approximately. About the same as that gas guzzling v6 or 4 cyl you were using before. Would eliminate the use of a large battery bank not to mention the weight of the battery bank you was going to use on your EV. <span class="caps">AND</span> you could go further, A <span class="caps">LOT</span> further. </p>

	<p>Another thing, you could use an industrial factory single phase AC motor for the generator, just use a 10 inch pulley on the motor and a 1 inch pulley on the generator shaft, this will make your electric motor seem like it&#8217;s running full capacity, when in fact it&#8217;s running only about halfway (450rpm x 10 = 4500rpm&#8217;s on the generator continuous). Saves the hassle of ruining your motor(s), and it wont get hot and shut down, or cog on you. (this is provided you&#8217;re using an AC motor. If you&#8217;re using  DC motor for the drive train, then you&#8217;ll have to use an AC to DC converter.) Still you&#8217;ll be ahead regardless. Not as costly as the major battery bank. Worth looking into.</p>

	<p>Plus this application may allow you to drive hundreds of miles if not further than those ridiculous sad excuses for a hybrid the car companies are coming out with now. </p>

	<p>Car companies, if you&#8217;re reading this&#8230; <strong>think locomotive</strong>. The train is the <span class="caps">ONLY</span> <span class="caps">TRUE</span> hybrid utilizing a generator to make electricity for the DC motors. Cause electric motors have more torque to begin with. Stop stringing the general public with junk, and build something that will last for a change!</p>

	<p>Hi Jerry</p>

	<p>Since passenger compartment heating and cooling takes a lot of energy and energy is at  a premium in EVs, quite  a lot of people who convert leave these out. However, you can heat with an electric reistance heater matrix cut into the ventilation system. You can also heat with an electric water heater similar to the Canadian block heaters which is plumbed into the original cabin heater matrix.</p>

	<p>You can cool by using the existing A/C unit by either running it&#8217;s pump via a belt from the back of the motor or by supplying an extra motor dedicated to the A/C pump. If you visit <a href="http://www.evalbum.com"><span class="caps">EVA</span>lbum</a> you&#8217;ll probably come across all of these configurations.</p>

	<p>hi,<br />
I am an American in Beijing, and I see the &#8220;wheel hub motors&#8221; every day on the ubiquitous electric bikes and scooters here in China. I was wondering what I should call them; now I know! thanks.<br />
I&#8217;m enjoying both your EV conversion blog/sites,<br />
I am planning on a project soon, a small 3 wheel cycle-car and/or a gas-to-EV conversion similar to yours&#8230;<br />
(you have a great sense of humor too!) Grazie!</p>

	<p>EV Dreamer, great point. As a kid I always wondered why I couldn&#8217;t have a elec.motor &amp; gen. connected together to produce an infinite supply of electricity (yes, I understand the friction/loss concept) Locomotive? why not. I think I&#8217;ll set this up on a test bench and view the pro&#8217;s &amp; con&#8217;s. <span class="caps">THX</span>!</p>
