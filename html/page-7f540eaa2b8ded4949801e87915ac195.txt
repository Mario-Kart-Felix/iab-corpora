			<h2>Craftsmanship</h2>
			<p>To garner a perfect 10 in this category requires a vehicle to be beautifully constructed from attractive and high-quality materials, have solid controls and switches that move with a well-damped action, and feel as if they were carved from a single ingot of metal, with no extraneous feedback or vibrations.

			<h2>Convenience / Technology</h2>
			<p>High-tech entertainment and communications systems are proliferating in modern vehicles so rapidly that our cars are beginning to resemble four-wheeled computers. The key&mdash;and the most important contributor to a "10" in this category&mdash;is a car with those technologies that truly make driving easier and more enjoyable, without distracting from the driver's ability to maintain complete control.</p>

		<div id="weather-info" class="metric-tt caret-bottom">
			<h2>All-weather Capability</h2>
			<p>About half of the American population lives in climates where snow and rain are frequent companions. With <em>Car and Driver's</em> headquarters being located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, we test-drive cars and trucks in such conditions all the time. We also seek out hilly and mountainous terrain, which places even greater demands on a vehicle's tractive capabilities.</p>

		<div id="handling-info" class="metric-tt caret-bottom">
			<h2>Handling and Steering</h2>
			<p>The most subjective aspect of vehicle evaluation is ride and handling. Not only do people have varying opinions about what feels the best, but ride and handling are very dependent on road surfaces and driving conditions. Top ratings in this category will go to vehicles that are very responsive and can corner at high speed, yet maintain excellent stability and don't beat you up when driving over a rough road. With their greater weight and higher centers of gravity, SUVs won't be getting top marks here, so consider anything above a 7 a good score for one of those versatile vehicles. Here you'll find a few tips on what you should look for.</p>

			<h2>Performance</h2>
			<p>In recent years, no aspect of automotive technology has progressed as rapidly as powertrain performance&mdash;something we at <em>Car and Driver</em> have been documenting since 1956. In fact, we've been at the forefront of developing and employing the latest instrumentation to accurately test cars for more than 30 years, and we've made it our mission to objectively measure the acceleration, braking, and handling performance of every car and truck sold in America.</p>

			<h2>Safety Features</h2>
			<p>Drivers today are surrounded by more safety technology than ever before, thanks to numerous advances on modern cars. In the old days, the focus was exclusively on passive safety systems, such as airbags, which helped reduce the severity of an impact on vehicle occupants. Today, there is a greater emphasis on active safety, or systems that can help you avoid a crash in the first place. Getting a 10 in this category requires the best of both worlds&mdash;top ratings in the various crash tests, as well as a portfolio of well-executed, active safety systems.</p>

				<div id="pdt-craftsmanship-intro" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					To garner a perfect 10 in this category requires a vehicle to be beautifully constructed from attractive and high-quality materials, have solid controls and switches that move with a well-damped action, and feel as if they were carved from a single ingot of metal, with no extraneous feedback or vibrations. Not only does a well-built vehicle reflect its premium price, it also will drive better than one assembled with less attention to such essential&mdash;yet often overlooked&mdash;details.
					</p>
				</div>
	
				<div id="pdt-craftsmanship-body" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					A rigid structure is one of the most important aspects of a high-quality vehicle. A sturdy body allows the suspension to work better, reduces the noise and vibrations generated by suspension impacts, and helps the various seals and gaskets block wind and mechanical noise from the cabin. The trick is to make a structure rigid without adding weight, which saps both performance and fuel efficiency.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Most vehicles are constructed from steel stampings, which are then welded together. However, more and more luxury cars are replacing some of the steel panels&mdash;typically doors, hoods, and fenders&mdash;with lighter aluminum equivalents. A few cars, such as the Audi A8 or Jaguar XJ, even have their entire bodies constructed of aluminum panels, which can be riveted, welded, or even glued together&mdash;with or without an aluminum subframe. Aluminum construction has few downsides other than its higher cost to implement 
					and repair.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As pressure increases to improve fuel economy, we expect to see more aluminum vehicles, as well as even lighter materials, such as carbon fiber. This is a composite material similar to fiberglass, except that carbon fiber is much stronger and lighter. It's also much more expensive, which is why carbon fiber primarily has been confined to racing cars and aircraft.
					</p>

				</div>
	
				<div id="pdt-craftsmanship-fit" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					We expect a rich look in a luxury vehicle, which comes from many subtle cues. Does the wood trim look like real wood, or just like a picture of wood laminated to a hunk of plastic? It's particularly satisfying when a thin finish on a vehicle's wood trim allows your fingertips to feel a bit of grain. When carbon-fiber or aluminum trim is used, it should be the real thing&mdash;not some cheap imitation.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Leather should feel soft, supple, and show a hint of its natural grain. Soft plastic trim with a matte finish feels warmer and more inviting than the hard, glossy variety. Carpeting should be plush yet resilient. All of the dashboard components should fit together well with only the smallest of gaps visible. When we evaluate a vehicle's interior, we use the edge of a business card to gauge the consistency of the fit&mdash;it's an indication of the attention to detail an automaker has lavished on its fleet. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When you open the lid of the center console, does it wobble when you push it sideways? Are the trunk hinges similarly solid? Do they protrude into the trunk, or use neat linkages to prevent intrusion into the cargo space? Do the door hinges work silently and smoothly? Are the various bins and cubbies padded to make sure that their contents won't rattle around inside them? Does the action of switches feel solid and well-damped? A premium vehicle should be strong on all of these details.
					</p>

				</div>
	
				<div id="pdt-craftsmanship-paint" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					The highest-quality paint finishes look like a tinted mirror. If you examine the reflection of a cumulus cloud on the hood of a perfectly painted car, you will be able to see every detail of the cloud formation. Similarly, the reflection of a fluorescent light fixture will show every tube to be perfectly straight and parallel.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Most finishes have some slight degree of waviness to them and it's worth comparing the vertical and horizontal panels for consistency. Another important area to compare is the finish on the body panels and the plastic parts, such as the bumpers. These are often painted using different processes than the metal parts, but they should still look the same.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Metal trim is also a key element to a rich look. Anything that looks like metal should be metal, and it should glint with a deep and flawless shine. Wheels provide an excellent opportunity for ornamentation and their paint, polish, and plating should match the same high standard that's visible elsewhere on the vehicle.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					We also check the panel fit. Modern cars should have roughly an eighth-inch gap between panels, and those gaps should be very consistent across the entire body's construction.
					</p>

				</div>
	
				<div id="pdt-craftsmanship-noise" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					A car can look great, but if it feels tinny and noisy, the illusion of quality will be shattered. In a luxury vehicle, you want to keep the outside world at a certain distance. That's why we use dedicated sound meters to measure cabin noise.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Low noise means having a body shape designed to minimize wind whistle and excellent door and window seals to block any remaining sound from the cabin. It also means tight seals between the cabin and the engine compartment to block mechanical noises. The suspension also needs tuned isolators to attenuate pavement roar and the thump of bumps and pock-marked pavement.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					We don't want any vibration from the engine or suspension, either. Nor should there be any harsh impacts or lurches as the transmission shifts gears or the suspension goes through its motions. It should feel like the precisely engineered, sophisticated machine that it is.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					This doesn't mean that your luxury vehicle has to be an isolation chamber. A dollop of pure and pleasing engine sound, particularly at full throttle, is always welcome, as is a sense of what your tires are doing 
					on the road surface. But these impressions should always be clear, muted, and agreeable without 
					being coarse.
					</p>

The key&mdash;and the most important contributor to a "10" in this category&mdash;is a car with those technologies that truly make driving easier and more enjoyable, without distracting from the driver's ability to maintain complete control.
				</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-tech-infotainment" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Infotainment systems are quickly moving beyond merely connecting the vehicle to a personal electronic device. The next step is to incorporate various apps while using your cell phone to connect to the internet. Such apps can go well beyond the capabilities of your vehicle's navigation system to find local shopping, dining, and other useful destinations. They can also tap into other sources of information such as investment quotes, local gas prices, various streaming music services, and many others.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Onboard Wi-Fi is already offered on a few cars&mdash;even some outside of the luxury category&mdash;and when coupled to a plug-in internet hotspot, can let passengers surf the web while driving. Such technologies will proliferate and advance rapidly.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Another feature that is imminent is the ability to receive and send e-mail in the car. This feature is highly dependent on voice technology so that e-mails can be read aloud and the driver can dictate replies. This will require excellent voice-recognition technology&mdash;much better than the current state of the art&mdash;to avoid excessive driver distraction. 
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-tech-interfaces" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					We believe the key to all onboard electronics is ease of operation. The least-distracting way to operate any infotainment system is through voice activation. But most systems still require that you use a small set of preprogrammed commands. Still, some systems have larger vocabularies than others and it's critical to use them all in order to make your own assessment.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Similarly, there are various non-vocal means of controlling your automotive electronics, including LCD touch screens, large control knobs, mini-mouses, and even small pads on which your fingers can spell out commands and letters.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					These all have their pros and cons. For example, LCD touch screens are intuitive to use, but the screen must be in the dashboard close to the driver, and it is susceptible to fingerprints and glare from the sun. They also require the driver to take his eyes away from the road longer than does a screen mounted higher, close to the windshield, and is controlled by a knob.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Taking the time to try these various approaches before you buy is a good idea because the best choice will be a matter of personal preference as much as anything.

				</ul>
		
				<div id="pdt-weather-intro" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					About half of the American population lives in climates where snow and rain are frequent companions. With <em>Car and Driver's</em> headquarters being located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, we test-drive cars and trucks in such conditions all the time. We also seek out hilly and mountainous terrain, which places even greater demands on a vehicle's tractive capabilities. So it doesn't surprise us that all-wheel-drive vehicles have become extremely popular and are offered by almost all luxury-car brands. A top score of 10 in this area will go to a vehicle that has an excellent all-wheel-drive system combined with capable all-weather tires, as well as excellent lighting and windshield wipers. Ultra-performance sports cars, with wide, grippy, summer tires will pay the penalty for their specialization. When it comes to a vehicle's all-weather capability, we consider the following individual criteria: the type of all-wheel drive system it uses, its type of tires, and how welll its windshield wipers and headlamps perform.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-weather-drive" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Front-wheel drive offers greater inclement weather traction than does rear-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive is best of all. That's why AWD has become so common on luxury cars. These systems are permanently at the ready and require no input from the driver to deliver optimal traction.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Some of these systems operate primarily in two-wheel-drive mode, automatically switching to AWD when additional traction is needed. Most of these systems, however, are continuously sending power to all four wheels. Either approach works when the pavement turns slick, but the more sophisticated systems also improve handling during dry conditions.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Those systems do this by typically sending about 60 percent of the power to the rear wheels to produce more balanced and responsive performance. A number of AWD systems use the brakes to occasionally limit the power at individual wheels. By doing so, they vary the application of power from front to rear&mdash;and sometimes even side to side. But the best systems, such as the one in the Audi S4, can actively distribute the power to the individual wheels by using sophisticated differentials to provide greater agility when you're driving quickly. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					All-wheel drive does add some weight and driveline friction, which usually costs a small amount of fuel efficiency. But it's well worth it if you want that extra margin of all-weather security.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-weather-tires" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Modern tires are extremely specialized and no single tire design can deliver outstanding performance under all conditions. The qualities that make a great, high-performance tire&mdash;a low profile and wide footprint, sparse and shallow tread grooves, stiff construction, and a high-temperature tread compound&mdash;are exactly wrong for good performance in the snow. In fact, some ultra-performance summer tires are not supposed to be driven at low exterior temperatures, even on dry pavement.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Therefore, if good snow performance is a priority, you should make sure that you select an all-season tire to go with a front-drive or AWD vehicle. Or you should be prepared to change to full winter tires in the cold and snowy months. With full winter tires, you can easily negotiate slick, frigid weather in most parts of the country, even in a high-performance, rear-drive vehicle. Conversely, not even AWD will provide safe winter performance if your car has high-performance summer rubber.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Tires are an important part of any vehicle's ride and handling, and they are especially critical when it comes to winter driving. It's also worth keeping in mind that all-season tires often ride more smoothly and create less road noise than either the extreme summer or winter tires&mdash;though they can't match the performance of either.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-weather-wipers" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					You can't drive if you can't see, and winter's early nights and gloomy weather can wreak havoc on your visibility. That's one reason why many modern luxury carmakers have switched from incandescent to high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps. HID lamps use less electricity to save fuel while emitting a brighter&mdash;and whiter&mdash;beam of light.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Common on many luxury cars, projector lenses take advantage of this superior lighting technology by accurately focusing light where you need it the most. Some headlamps even have swiveling projector beams that turn with your front wheels to help you see farther ahead on dark, winding country roads.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Light-emitting diode (LED) lamps are just now going into production and they are even more energy efficient than HID lights. Moreover, since LED headlights employ a number of LEDs, they can be tailored to even more accurately place the light where it's needed.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Of course, this enhanced lighting won't help if your windshield is covered with rain or snow. Modern luxury cars&mdash;especially the ones designed in Germany, where people regularly drive faster than 100 mph in the rain, have carefully designed wipers that stay in contact with the windshield and clear it effectively, even at very high speeds.

				<div id="pdt-handling-intro" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					The most subjective aspect of vehicle evaluation is ride and handling. Not only do people have varying opinions about what feels the best, but ride and handling are very dependent on road surfaces and driving conditions. Top ratings in this category will go to vehicles that are very responsive and can corner at high speed, yet maintain excellent stability and don't beat you up when driving over a rough road. With their greater weight and higher centers of gravity, SUVs won't be getting top marks here, so consider anything above a 7 a good score for one of those versatile vehicles. Here you'll find a few tips on what you should look for.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-handling-steering" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Perhaps the most important control in any vehicle is the steering. Not only does it direct where you are going, but it's one that you're constantly manipulating.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					The effort needed to turn the steering wheel should tell you how hard your tires are working. Ideally, the effort will be greater when you're squealing your tires in a corner and easier when you are just cruising. We find that on a bumpy road, good steering will also provide feedback through the steering wheel to let you know the conditions of the road surface.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					We also appreciate feeling a definite sense of on-center&mdash;a narrow band of low steering effort&mdash;to make it less demanding to maintain a steady course. At the same time, when we turn the wheel, we want the vehicle to start changing direction immediately, with continuous, fluid motion. Steering effort should also increase in proportion to the degree of our steering inputs. This delicate balance of responsiveness and stability is not easy to achieve.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Most steering systems are hydraulically assisted, but more manufacturers are offering electric power-steering systems that improve fuel economy by eliminating the hydraulic steering pump. Unfortunately, many of these setups feel artificial and disconnected from what is happening with the wheels and tires. We've observed major differences among these systems, so pay close attention to steering feel and responsiveness on your test drive.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-handling-body" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Body control is the one aspect of ride and handling that is easy to describe. Basically, you don't want the vehicle's body to pitch or roll no matter how spirited your driving, or how rough the road surface. In the perfect car, the wheels and the suspension would move freely to absorb all of the ride motions, leaving the body undisturbed while you and your passengers enjoy serene comfort and calm. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Achieving composed body control is easier said than done, since suspensions cannot completely separate wheel motions from body motions. During a test drive, we'll brake hard to make sure that the front end lowers gradually, rather than diving suddenly. When negotiating an S-turn at high speed, we want to feel the body rolling from side to side in a smooth and controlled fashion. And when driving quickly over a big bump, we don't want to experience any bouncing or floating motions. One fluid motion up and down should be sufficient.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					On a road with bumps on one side, we look for our vehicle to absorb those imperfections without snapping sideways and tossing our heads. Good body control not only enhances your comfort, but provides a solid platform to allow the suspension to do its best work.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-handling-grip" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Grip is simply a measure of cornering traction, and we gauge it by recording a vehicle's speed while driving around a circle of known radius. A simple calculation yields the resulting force of gravity experienced, represented in g's. At 1.00 g, a vehicle is pushing you sideways against its door panel as hard as gravity is pulling you into your seat.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Only top sports cars can corner at 1.00 g or more. But some luxury sedans can corner above 0.90 g and most can exceed 0.85 g. Some of the sportier luxury SUVS can even reach the 0.80 g range.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Cornering grip is aided by large wheels and sticky tires. But large wheels and tires weigh more than smaller ones, and we've found that this can negatively affect ride comfort. Moreover, excessively wide tires can compromise steering feel. And when you design a suspension for maximum grip, the end result is often a car that is marginally stable under normal driving conditions. This is one reason why racing cars, which are set up just this way, need talented drivers.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Since most people spend little time cornering at the limit, overall responsiveness and stability are more important than grip. But the 10s on our scale deliver full measures of all of these qualities.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-handling-ride" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					The ability of a suspension to smoothly and quietly absorb road imperfections is a measure of its ride quality. Combining a good ride with responsive handling is difficult because each attribute requires nearly opposite suspension settings. And those settings are also different for low- and high-speed suspension impacts.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When we test for ride quality, we drive over the roughest roads in our area. You should, too. Pay attention to body motions when you drive over large bumps. Make sure that both ends of the vehicle move in coordinated fashion without tilting the body towards the front or the rear. Note both the impact and the sound when you hit a pothole or expansion strip. Ideally, you will feel and hear one subdued thump with no aftershocks reverberating through the body. Also make a point to drive over the loudest type of road surfaces&mdash;usually a concrete highway&mdash;to evaluate how well the vehicle subdues road noise.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Many luxury cars now use electronically adjustable suspensions, which tailor their settings for various driving conditions and driver preferences. The best of these can make a sedan feel like a boulevard cruiser at low speeds and a track-ready sports car when you're driving with enthusiasm.

				</ul>
		
				<div id="pdt-performance-intro" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					In recent years, no aspect of automotive technology has progressed as rapidly as powertrain performance&mdash;something we at <em>Car and Driver</em> have been documenting since 1956. In fact, we've been at the forefront of developing and employing the latest instrumentation to accurately test cars for more than 30 years, and we've made it our mission to objectively measure the acceleration, braking, and handling performance of every car and truck sold in America. We also carefully rate the subjective qualities of a vehicle, such as its driving refinement, its stability and responsiveness, its ease of operation, and many others aspects of the behind-the-wheel experience. Every month, year in and year out, we test more cars than any other publication, and our collective testing experience is unmatched by any other magazine in the world.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					To help you make the best luxury-vehicle choice, we've rated the performance of each vehicle in this Advisor on a scale of 1 to 10, based on its 0-to-60 mph acceleration, its stopping distance from 70 mph, its mechanical refinement, and its overall efficiency. We have drawn from our extensive portfolio of comparison tests to inform these vehicle ratings, which you will see when you start comparing cars in the Advisor. As you read along, you'll learn more about the attributes we consider in our evaluations, and what we factor in to compile the ratings.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-performance-engines" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Start by forgetting everything you think you know about modern luxury-car engines. Today's V-6s provide the power and performance of yesterday's V-8s, while most four-cylinder engines are stronger than V-6s of just a few years ago. A perfect example is the current Audi A4 Quattro, which uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder to accelerate to 60 mph in about six seconds flat. The 1997 Audi A8&mdash;a bigger car, but one with a 4.2-liter V-8 under its hood&mdash;needed almost a second more to reach 60 when we tested it in January 1997.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					These new turbocharged and supercharged engines make big power, while still modestly sipping fuel when cruising down the highway. Moreover, they thrive at low rpm, replicating the effortless muscle that once was a V-8 exclusive. 
					For those who want more, there are V-8s and V-12s with more than 500 horsepower and some with upwards of 600 horsepower. Even the quickest muscle cars wouldn't stand a chance against a powerful, modern luxury model.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					On the fuel-efficiency side, luxury hybrids are proliferating rapidly and diesels also are making a comeback. The latter have tremendous low-rpm torque, which makes them ideal partners with automatic transmissions. As an example, BMW offers turbocharged 3.0-liter gasoline and diesel engines. The gas engine develops 300 pound-feet of peak torque&mdash;the diesel has 425.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-performance-transmissions" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					It wasn't that long ago that four-speed automatic transmissions were considered cutting-edge. Now, six speeds are the price of admission for mainstream cars and plenty of luxury models offer seven or even eight gears. With a very tall top gear, these transmissions let us cruise on the highway at 2000 rpm or less, which delivers excellent fuel economy. At the same time, a low first gear helps achieve impressive acceleration from a standing start while closely spaced intermediate gears help keep the engine near its power peak for maximum performance.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					With computer-controlled shifting, we've been amazed by how smoothly these transmissions downshift&mdash;sometimes three gears at a time&mdash;to deliver performance when we've asked for it.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					An increasingly popular alternative to these advanced automatics is the dual-clutch transmission. We've been impressed by their fuel efficiency as well as their sportier driving feel. But they can't quite match the seamless operation of a conventional automatic, or the thrill of a manual rev-matched downshift&mdash;although some are coming very close.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Even pure manual transmissions are experiencing gear proliferation. Porsche, for example, has just introduced a seven-speed manual gearbox. Others undoubtedly will follow.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-performance-performance" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Back in 1980, we were impressed by performance cars that could accelerate to 60 mph in the six-second range. Today, that's what we expect of entry-level luxury cars powered by the smallest engines. Mid-range models with naturally aspirated six-cylinders under their hoods are typically in the mid-five-second range, while naturally aspirated V-8s are around five seconds flat.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					For those who crave even more speed, just about every luxury maker offers a performance sub-brand. Powered by turbocharged or supercharged V-8s and V-12s, these models can accelerate to 60 in around four seconds flat. The quickest of all the sedans is the Porsche Panamera Turbo, which stunned us with a 3.3-second 0&mdash;60 time, thanks to its all-wheel drive and computerized launch control. We'd give that a 10 for acceleration.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					If your taste runs more toward sports cars, you can shave about a second from each category, with the very quickest models&mdash;such as the Porsche 911 Turbo S and Bugatti Veyron&mdash;dipping into the mid-two-second area.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Of course you pay a fuel-economy penalty for such performance, especially if you indulge your need for speed regularly. But even the fastest models deliver surprising efficiency when driven moderately.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-performance-powertrain" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					When comparing engines, we've learned to focus on more than peak horsepower. While power is the ultimate arbiter of performance, we've observed that everyday driving is more influenced by an engine's torque curve. Torque is the amount of instant thrust that an engine can produce, while power is the product of torque and rpm. When you floor the accelerator, torque is immediate, but power doesn't make itself felt until you downshift and the rpm rise.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					The newest supercharged or turbocharged engines develop their peak torque at low rpm&mdash;often below 2000 on the tachometer. So your car moves immediately as you lean into the throttle, just as if there were a giant V-8 under the hood.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Moreover, the latest transmissions with six, seven, and eight speeds can downshift almost seamlessly to provide maximum acceleration at your command.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					During your test drive, be sure to accelerate gradually and observe how the engine and transmission behave. Do it slowly and also a little faster to feel how responsive&mdash;and smooth&mdash;the powertrain is.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-performance-braking" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Today's astonishing performance would be dangerous if it weren't accompanied by equally powerful brakes. Large brake rotors not only absorb more of the heat generated when stopping a car, they also provide greater leverage for their stout brake calipers. These calipers are often machined from a single chunk of aluminum to provide an ideal combination of greater stiffness and lower weight. The greater stiffness allows the brake pads to grip the rotors more efficiently; it also improves brake feel by reducing flexing. One expensive option offered on some models is carbon-ceramic rotors, which are extremely effective and much lighter than conventional cast-iron rotors&mdash;and cost several thousand dollars.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Coupled to ever-stickier tires, these big brakes can achieve remarkably short stopping distances. From 70 mph, most luxury cars can stop within 160 to 170 feet. Luxury SUVs are roughly 10 feet behind, while sports cars are in the 150-foot range; the best of them, 10s on our scale, dip into the 140s.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Most important of all, thanks to these powerful brakes, modern cars can perform repeatedly such short stops, without experiencing dangerous brake fade like their predecessors.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-performance-braking-feel" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Powerful brakes are important, but you also want your brakes to operate precisely to make it easier to drive your car smoothly. We don't like a soft pedal that feels spongy and ineffective. Nor do we appreciate an abrupt action that has us thrown against the seatbelt at the first touch of the pedal.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Ideally, we prefer brakes that are nicely coordinated in three areas: how much effort is required to apply the pedal, how far the pedal travels, and how quickly the car stops. When all three are proportional, driving smoothly requires almost no conscious effort. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					We've found that hybrid models have a much tougher time achieving this ideal coordination because they must transition from their electronic regenerative brakes to the conventional hydraulic brakes midway through their operation. This transition is hardly ever seamless and can be quite abrupt&mdash;behavior unbecoming of a true luxury car.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Since you'll be using the brakes every time you're behind the wheel, you should make a point of evaluating brake feel on every vehicle you are considering. 
					</p>

				<div id="pdt-safety-intro" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					Drivers today are surrounded by more safety technology than ever before, thanks to numerous advances on modern cars. In the old days, the focus was exclusively on passive safety systems, such as airbags, which helped reduce the severity of an impact on vehicle occupants. Today, there is a greater emphasis on active safety, or systems that can help you avoid a crash in the first place. Getting a 10 in this category requires the best of both worlds&mdash;top ratings in the various crash tests, as well as a portfolio of well-executed, active safety systems.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-safety-passive" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					The most important safety device in the car remains the seatbelt, but today it is supplemented by front, side, head, and, sometimes, knee airbags. These various airbags not only provide additional cushioning in a high-speed crash, but they can also help prevent major and minor injuries in lower-speed collisions.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Even the simple seatbelt has a few safety tricks these days, including pretensioners that tighten the belts on impact to minimize occupants' forward motion, and tension limiters to allow the belts to yield slightly in a severe crash to possibly lessen the severity of injury. We are also starting to see the introduction of inflatable seatbelts for rear-seat passengers to provide more cushioning in high-speed crashes. Some cars also have active headrests which move to their most supportive position in a crash.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					On many luxury cars, manufacturers are offering adaptive cruise-control systems that gauge your distance from the cars in front of you, and can even anticipate crashes. When they determine that a collision is unavoidable, they can work in tandem with other vehicle systems to close the sunroof, lock the doors, and even move the seats into their optimal positions with the goal of minimizing potential injuries. 
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="pdt-safety-active" class="pd-sub-tab-content">

					<p>
					The best crash is the one that doesn't happen. One effective system to reduce crashes is stability control, which detects when you are losing control in a corner and selectively applies the brakes to keep your car on its intended path.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Anti-lock brakes (ABS) help avoid wheel lock-up on all surfaces and also let you steer while braking to help you avoid any obstacles in your path.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Traction control limits wheelspin to optimize vehicle traction on slippery surfaces. Lane-departure warning systems alert you when you are drifting out of your lane. Blind-spot warning systems let you know when there is a car behind you that is out of your line of vision. Some cars will even help steer you back into your lane if you don't take corrective action.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Some cars employ vehicle-sensing radar to warn you about stopped or slow-moving vehicles in front of you&mdash;and will even tell the vehicle to apply the brakes automatically in an effort to avoid the accident.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					These technologies all provide safety benefits, but they can also feel intrusive, particularly if they engage too early and/or too often. That's why we prefer having the ability turn these systems&mdash;other than ABS&mdash;off when we want a more involved driving experience.
