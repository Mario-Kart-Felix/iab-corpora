	<p>
		<big>Automotive and trucking industrty resources and information for the United States market. &nbsp;A forth-coming directory of important players and can&#39;t miss deals.</big></p>
	<h2>
		<big>Getting Back On Track...</big></h2>
	<p>
		<big>The US automotive industry has experience a huge setback due to laziness, ineptness and the ability to envision, but it is coming back after a long overdue bounceback.&nbsp; The problem was self inflicted, as automotive industry executives either weren&#39;t on the ball, or had completely lost sight of it. &nbsp;It seems that the laxidasical attitudes of the industry are finally taking the threat from Japan the rest of the world&#39;s auto makers seriously.&nbsp;</big></p>
	<p>
		<big>The US truck industry is still experiencing similar problems, though the problems stem more from lack of care than incompetence.&nbsp; Brands have been sold and resold until we have no idea what forgeign market is sitting behind the semi rigs that we build.&nbsp;</big></p>
	<p>
		<big>Both the automotive and truck industries represent fractional shadows of their former selves.&nbsp; However, quality manufacturing has become a priority and the American consumer is begining to notice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the American market has already established loyalty with other import brands.</big></p>
	<p>
		<big>One good thing of note is that the American motorcycle industry has been back on track for some time, now. &nbsp;Harley-Davidson was bought by the management and revitalized with a drive for producing the most well manufactured motorcycles on the planet. &nbsp;New manufacturers have arrisen with Victory big twins as well as the resurrection of our old favorite American motorcycle manufacturer, the Indian. &nbsp;</big></p>
	<p>
		<big>Should the automotive industry take any note of the success earned by the motorcycle industry it has to be to put quality first, a lesson it has not only totally ignored, but had completely dismissed somewhere on its way. &nbsp;Thankfully, this is the case no more as the new models that Detroit has been revealing has indicated since shortly after the turn of the century.</big></p>
	<p>
		<big>It&#39;s going to be a long road back to a healthy economy, and American innovation and technology must lead the way.&nbsp; If anyone thinks that they can relax and sit on their duff in this industry, they are sadly mistaken, and will be bankrupt sooner than ever.</big></p>
	<h2>
		autotruck.us is Getting Back On Track...</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Auto &amp; Truck</strong> is getting back on-track, as well. &nbsp;Our old site was a library of automotive articles that started out to be a good resource, until the spammers got wind of the system we used and it was spammed with way too many junk posts and non-automotive related crap. &nbsp;Quite honestly, it turned into a nightmare to maintain because there was no way to keep spammers out of the system. &nbsp;Some of the posts didn&#39;t even make sense.</p>
	<p>
		After years of deleting crap posts, we have re-evaluated the site and addressed its lack of success and therefore discontinued the re-posting (or re-blogging) of already published material. &nbsp;Just because it has been used before doesn&#39;t make it any good. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		Although there were many quality articles concerning a wide variety of automotive subjects, quite honestly, the spammers have overloaded us with work and we can no longer keep up. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		So right now we are taking a breather as we reinvent what autotruck.us will become in the future. &nbsp;Stay tuned to find out, I am sure you will be impressed in the long run.</p>
