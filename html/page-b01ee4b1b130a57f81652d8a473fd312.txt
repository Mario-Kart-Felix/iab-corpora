<h1>Recreational Vehicle Testing</h1>

<p>NATCs experience with RV testing not only enables us to 
perform FMVSS certifications but also ride and handling evaluations, vehicle 
durability, ride quality evaluations and localized vibration testing. In 
addition to physical testing, NATC performs virtual proving ground analysis of 
RV designs against their duty cycle. NATCs modeling and simulation department 
has the ability to perform Finite Element Analysis on vehicle chassis and frames 
to identify high stress areas, as well as using vehicle modeling and simulation 
to evaluate vehicle suspension designs for ride characteristics and Ackerman 
steering geometry. </p>

<img border="1" src="images/RV.htm1.jpg" align="right" class="IMG-RIGHT" width="280" height="199">

<p>NATCs engineers are 
experienced in conducting the SAE J2014 double lane change maneuver as well as 
other dynamic vehicle handling events such as the lateral stability (200 foot 
constant radius curve), over/under steer evaluations, step steer evaluations, 
J-turns and 180 degree U-turns. Using these test events the handling 
characteristics of an RV can be quantified and compared. The suspension setup 
can then be optimized based on the handling and ride quality desired by the 
customer, manufacturer or as recommended by NATC based on our past experience 
and vehicle knowledge. </p>

<p>NATC has performed 
durability testing on vehicles ranging from passenger cars to large multi axle 
off-road vehicles, and recreational vehicles. NATC has established user and road 
profiles for areas all over the world including North America, South America, 
Asia and Europe. These profiles are used to determine how people in the selected 
region operate their vehicle and the severity of the roads in a given area. 
Whether the primary operating road is smooth pavement or degraded gravel, NATC 
utilizes the user and road profiles to determine the duty cycle of a vehicle. 
From this information an accelerated life cycle test can be established. This 
accelerated life cycle test enables NATC to test an RV to the equivalent of 
100,000 miles in less than 10,000 actual test miles. This helps identify 
potential warranty problems and areas that could be improved before a vehicle is 
sold. </p>

<p>NATCs experience with on 
and off-road vehicle brake systems enables us to not only perform full 
certification FMVSS 121 and FMVSS 105 brake testing, but to also advise on brake 
system design and improvement. NATC utilizes its 1.8 mile paved oval to perform 
all the brake burnish and service and emergency brake stops. NATC has concrete 
20 and 30 percent grades to evaluate vehicle parking brakes and a 500-foot 
constant radius curve which is used to perform stability and handling 
evaluations, which will be required for all vehicles manufactured in the near 
future under the FMVSS 121 requirements. </p>

<img border="1" src="/images/RV.htm4.jpg" align="right" class="IMG-RIGHT" width="271" height="203">

<p>NATCs instrumentation 
department can instrument vehicles to record all data required under FMVSS 
requirements as well as any other data a vehicle manufacturer may desire. 
Everything from brake shoe temperature to vibration measurements on any area of 
the vehicle can be recorded and reported to the customer. Accelerometer data can 
also be collected for any location on the vehicle. This acceleration data can be 
used to develop accelerated life tests for components such as VCRs, DVD players 
and televisions that will be installed in the vehicle. Performing this type of 
testing on aftermarket-installed items can identify components not suitable for 
the RV application and therefore increase the quality and reliability of the 
final RV and its components. </p>

<p>NATC has tested recreational vehicles from 
20 to over 50 feet in length and 20,000 to 55,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight 
Rating. NATC has the knowledge, facilities and experience to be your one stop 
testing location for all your recreational vehicle testing and design needs.
