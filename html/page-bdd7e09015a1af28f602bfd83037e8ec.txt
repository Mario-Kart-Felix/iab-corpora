<h5>
Buyer
Beware</h5>

<p class="secondP">Used cars
can be purchased at places other than dealerships. Private sellers advertise in the
classified sections of city, regional and neighborhood newspapers. Be aware, however, that
unlicensed dealers advertise in the classified section as well. Another name for an
unlicensed dealer is a curbstoner (they sell cars from the street-curb instead of from a
car lot). Curbstoners are people who make money from buying a used car and reselling it.

</p>

<h6><o:p><font SIZE="2"><a href="#Top of page">
<img border="0" src="images/toparrow.gif" align="right" width="22" height="41"></a></font>Here are some tips for identifying a curbstoner:</h6>

            <ul>
              <li>The
    vehicle is parked along the street or in a vacant lot;</li>
              <li>The
    person selling the car asks you to meet them at a location other than their residence;</li>
              <li>The
    seller wants a cash transaction, no checks or money orders;</li>
              <li>The
    title to the vehicle is not in the name of the seller. </li>
            </ul>


<p>Curbstoners
do not comply with state or federal laws and you have no protection in your dealings with
them. Buying from a curbstoner increases your risk of not being able to get the vehicle
title transferred, or of getting a car which has been previously wrecked or which has a
&quot;rolled back&quot; odometer. </p>

<p>If you
suspect you are dealing with a curbstoner please contact the BMV at:</p>

  <p>Ohio
  Bureau Of Motor Vehicles<br>
  ATTN. Investigations<br>
  PO Box 16784<br>

<h6>Questions To Ask The Person Selling The Car: </h6>

<p class="secondP">You should
ask these questions on the phone to help decide whether you want to go and see the car. <o:p><font SIZE="2"><a href="#Top of page">
<img border="0" src="images/toparrow.gif" align="right" width="22" height="41"></a></font></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Are you the owner of the
    car? </li>
              <li>How long have you owned
    the car? </li>
              <li>What is the mileage?
    (You might want to ask what the mileage was when the person bought the car.)
              </li>
              <li>How has the car been
    driven? (Around town vs. long trips) </li>
              <li>What are the car's best
    features? </li>
              <li>What major work have you
    done on the car? Any receipts? </li>
              <li>Did you buy the car new? </li>
              <li>Why are you selling the
    car? </li>
              <li>Has the car ever had
    problems with rust? Has the car ever been repainted? </li>
              <li>Has the car ever had
    body repairs? </li>
              <li>Do you have the title
    issued in your name? </li>
              <li>Are you a vehicle
    dealer? </li>
              <li>What would I need to do
    to put the car into top shape? </li>
            </ul>

<h6>Tips For Checking Out The Car:</h6>

<p class="secondP">When
purchasing a used car it's best to have a mechanic look at it. Even if you are spending
less than $1,000 on the car, a mechanic's inspection could save you money. </p>

<p>If you
don't want to spend the extra money on the mechanic, check it yourself. Take a friend or
relative with you to help. </p>

<p>Make
sure everything works. Radio, heater, windshield wipers, cigarette lighter, rear
window defogger, and horn. Try all the windows. Test the headlights, taillights, flashers,
backup lights, brake lights, turn signals, and parking lights. Check for proper seatbelt
operation. </p>

<p>The
brakes. While driving 30 to 40 mph, being certain there is no one behind you,
apply the brakes three or four times. If you get a consistent pull, either left or right,
while the brakes are being applied, there is a problem. Check brake fluid level. A low
level may indicate a brake problem. </p>

<p>The
tires. Check the tread for depth of wear, the tire sizes for matching, and for any
other obvious damage. All the tires should be evenly worn. Uneven wear could mean neglect,
abuse, improper wheel alignment or bent front-end components. <o:p><font SIZE="2"><a href="#Top of page">
<img border="0" src="images/toparrow.gif" align="right" width="22" height="41"></a></font></p>

<p>Under
the hood. Check all hoses. Examine the battery for leaks. Check the oil dipstick
(if the oil is dark and dirty, the car may not have been properly maintained). If the car
has an automatic transmission, check the transmission fluid to see if it is dark colored
or has a burned odor (it should be a reddish color). </p>

            <hr>

<h6>Odometer Fraud </h6>

<p class="secondP">Each year
approximately three million used cars have their odometers rolled back an average of
30,000 miles. </p>

<p>A BMV
investigator tells a true story of someone who drilled a hole right through the plastic
covering on the odometer to roll the odometer numbers back. Obviously he got caught, but
most &quot;roll backs&quot; are more sophisticated. </p>

<h6>There are
some things you can check to see of the odometer is correct. </h6>

            <ul>
              <li>VIN
    history check on mileage through BMV;</li>
              <li>Check to
    see if the numbers on the odometer line up. Rolled back odometers sometimes have
    misaligned numbers;</li>
              <li>Have a
    mechanic check the engine compression and look for worn struts or ball joints and
    transmission problems. These are all signs of high use;</li>
              <li>Check
    the wear on the clutch, brake, and accelerator pedals. If the odometer reads very low
    miles the pedals shouldn't show signs any excessive wear. </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>

<h6>How To Transfer a Title <o:p><font SIZE="2"><a href="#Top of page">
<img border="0" src="images/toparrow.gif" align="right" width="22" height="41"></a></font></h6>

<p class="secondP">Before
finalizing the deal and paying for the vehicle, be sure to get all the necessary papers to
title your vehicle. You will need the following items: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Odometer
    Disclosure Statement form filled out and signed by the owner and the buyer (if the car is
    10 years old or older you do not need the Federal Odometer Disclosure Statement);</li>
              <li>The
    owner must release his/her ownership in the vehicle. This is done by signing the
    appropriate space on the title. All persons listed on the title must sign it in the
    presence of a Notary;</li>
              <li>If the
    title is lost, you may apply for a duplicate title, only in the county where the title was
    originally issued;</li>
              <li>Bill of
    sale for tax calculation.</li>
            </ul>


<p>When you
go to a title office they will assist you in transferring the title. </p>

<p>There is a
penalty if the new owner does not change the title into their name within 30 calendar days
from the date of assignment. The penalty is $5.00 in addition to all other appropriate
fees. So do it soon! </p>

<p>After a
vehicle has been titled, you must go to to a deputy registrar to<o:p><font SIZE="2"><a href="#Top of page"><img border="0" src="images/toparrow.gif" align="right" width="22" height="41"></a></font> obtain a new set of
license plates for your vehicle, unless you are transferring plates from another vehicle. </p>
