          C.T.C's Auto Ranch Inc. Stocks Most Major Brands</span></p>
  <p align="center" class="style7"><span class="style5"><img src="star.JPG" width="181" height="192" align="left">At the Auto Ranch we strive to keep all the major brands of truly American cars from 1974 and older in stock. While we do occasionally buy newer cars, our goal is to stay in the Muscle Car and older era. <br>
          <br>
          The oldest car we currently have in stock is a 1936 Nash. We do have some cars in the early 40's, but our real strengths are in the Post-War Era. We have many late 40's cars even more from the 50's and 60's. While most collectors only like two-door hardtops because they bring a better return on their investment, the Auto Ranch will buy almost any American car, two-door, four-door or station wagon. We have a large selection of 50's, 60's, and 70's two and four door cars and pickups.<br>
          <br>
          We have an excellent stock of Muscle cars from the 60's through the mid 70's, and we're always on the lookout for more. Naturally, most cars have already had the really rare and desirable options removed. However, we do occasionally run across the intact &quot;gem&quot; and if it's a restorable, desirable car, we will try to sell it as a whole project car before trying to sell any parts from it.<br>
          <br>
          We also have a large stock of sheet metal, (doors, fenders, hoods and deck lids) that we have purchased from older salvage yards that have gone out of business. These parts were removed from various cars that were crushed years ago. Most of them are in very good condition with little or no rust. Best of all, they are already removed from the vehicles.<br>
          <br>
        C.T.C.'s Auto Ranch Inc., is located just 4 miles north of Denton, Texas, on Interstate 35. Going north on I-35, exit at the 474 mile marker (Cowling Rd) stay on service road. Heading south on I-35, exit at the 473 mile marker(Milam Rd.) go up &amp; cross the overpass &amp; circle around by Love's, then get on service road heading north.</span></p>
