Those incentives marked "(bill)" are still under consideration.  Some provide consumer tax benefits, others parking perks. Incentives that allow hybrids to use HOV lanes with only one passenger are under review in some states due to a concern that this incentive be allowed to phase out if HOV lanes become too crowded. We encourage you to contact your state and local representatives to voice your support for pending hybrid incentives in your state, or recommend to legislators in states without hybrid incentives that they introduce hybrid incentive bills on their own.  We are always trying to keep this list as comprehensive as possible, so if you know of a hybrid incentive in your city, county, or state that we haven't found out about, please  <a href="mailto:hybridcenter@ucsusa.org">let us know</a>.</p>			<p>|							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#Fed">Fed</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#"></a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#AR">AR</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#AZ">AZ</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#CA">CA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#CO">CO</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#CT">CT</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#DC">DC</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#DE">DE</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#FL">FL</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#GA">GA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#HI">HI</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#IA">IA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#ID">ID</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#IL">IL</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#IN">IN</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#KS">KS</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#KY">KY</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#LA">LA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#MA">MA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#MD">MD</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#ME">ME</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#MI">MI</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#MN">MN</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#MO">MO</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#MS">MS</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#MT">MT</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#NC">NC</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#ND">ND</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#NJ">NJ</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#NM">NM</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#NV">NV</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#NY">NY</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#OH">OH</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#OK">OK</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#OR">OR</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#PA">PA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#RI">RI</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#SC">SC</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#TN">TN</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#TX">TX</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#UT">UT</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#VA">VA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#VT">VT</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#WA">WA</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#WI">WI</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#WV">WV</a> |							<a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm#WY">WY</a> |			</p>							<a name="Fed"></a>				<h3>Federal</h3>				<p><b>Federal Plug-in Hybrid Tax Credit:</b> The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modifies the credit for qualified plug-in electric drive vehicles purchased between 12/31/2009 and 12/31/2011. The minimum amount of the credit for qualified plug-in electric drive vehicles is $2,500 and the credit tops out at $7,500, depending on the battery capacity. To qualify, vehicles must be newly purchased, have four or more wheels, have a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 14,000 lbs, and draw propulsion using a battery with at least four kilowatt hours that can be recharged from an external source of electricity.  The full amount of the credit will be reduced with respect to a manufacturer's vehicles after the manufacturer has sold at least 200,000 vehicles.  The credit will then phase out over a year.

<p><b>Federal Hybrid HOV Waiver:</b> On 03/10/06 the House of Representatives approved a $284 billion highway bill (H.R. 3) that included a waiver for states to be allowed to open the HOV lanes to hybrid cars rated at least 45 miles per gallon. Senator Jim Talent's (R-MO) successfully introduced an amendment to the Senate highway bill that would give states the discretion to open up their HOV lanes to hybrid vehicles that achieve at least a 50 percent increase in fuel efficiency in the city and a 25 percent increase in fuel efficiency in combined city-highway miles over the non-hybrid model, regardless of the number of passengers and as long as it meets any Tier 2 federal emissions standard. This allowed vehicles such as the Ford Escape Hybrid to qualify. President Bush signed H.R. 3 into law the week of 08/08/06. The EPA provided guidance on this law on 05/17/07, noting that hybrid vehicles that achieve at least a 50 percent increase in fuel efficiency in the city and a 25 percent increase in fuel efficiency in combined city-highway miles over the non-hybrid model, and met federal Tier 2, Bin 5 emissions standards would qualify for the exemption, but states can opt to toughen EPA's criteria, though may not reduce them.  Details of the EPA guidance can be found <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/8822edaadaba0243852572a000656841/649ef12b8763f5e4852572de0050f59d!OpenDocument"target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


<p><b>Federal Tax Credits for Advanced Vehicles:</b> On 08/08/05, President Bush signed the comprehensive energy bill into law. Included were new tax credits for advanced vehicle technologies ranging from $250 to $3,400 depending on the vehicle's level of fuel economy improvement.  For a limited time, quality hybrids like the Honda Civic Hybrid, Toyota Prius or Ford Escape Hybrid qualified for tax credits in the range of $1,700-$3,150. The tax credits were available from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2010, though they expired earlier for the most popular hybrids. The full tax credits are available until a manufacturer reaches 60,000 vehicles sold (60,000 for Toyota, 60,000 for Ford, etc.). Once a manufacturer has sold 60,000 vehicles, a one-year "phase out" will begin after the next complete calendar quarter; 50 percent of the credit will be available for that manufacturer's hybrids in the first two quarters of the phaseout period and 25 percent in the final two quarters.</p> 
<p><u>Update</u>: Toyota, Honda, and Ford have met the 60,000 sales threshold. Federal tax credits are no longer available on hybrid vehicles from these automakers. An IRS list of the currently available tax credits for the 2010 and 2011 models of BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Mercedes, Mercury, and Nissan hybrids can be found <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=203122,00.html"target="_blank">here</a>. Not yet listed on the IRS website is the tax credit for the 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid that will go on sale in mid-December. It will qualify for a $1,300 federal tax credit. The Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid also qualifies for a $1,800 tax credit. Please note, however, these credits expire on 12/31/10. To take advantage of this tax credit, you must purchase your hybrid before 12/31/10.</p>

Napolitano issued Executive Order 2006-13 which officially began the Arizona hybrid HOV program. Drivers of all model years of the Honda Insight, Honda Civic Hybrid and Toyota Prius can apply to participate in the Energy Efficiency Plate program. Once you have the special license plate affixed to your car, you can drive in HOV lanes regardless of the number of people in your vehicle. The special license plate can be ordered online at www.servicearizona.com or by calling (602) 255-0072. <br><br><u>Update</u>: The program has issued the maximum limit of 10,000 special plates and there are no more available at this time. 
<br><br><u>Update</u>: S.B. 1320 - 491R, signed by the Governor 07/13/09, requires the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) to set procedures to monitor the effect of single occupancy vehicles in HOV lanes. The bill formally removes the ability for a person to drive a hybrid vehicle in a HOV lane with alternative fuel special plates, or an alternative fuel sticker, and a hybrid vehicle sticker. It also bans a person who owns a hybrid vehicle from acquiring an alternative fuels special plate. Instead, the bill creates a Low Emissions and Energy Efficient Vehicles (LEEV) special plate for use of HOV lanes regardless of occupancy. If approved by the federal government, this plate is available to any car that achieves no less than a 50 percent increase in city fuel economy or no less than a 25 percent increase in combined city-highway fuel economy and meets the Tier II emissions level. Hybrid owners can acquire these plates if their vehicles meet the requirements. However, if travel speeds in HOV lane become “degraded due to the authorization of single occupancy vehicles,” ADOT will limit or suspend the issuance of LEEV plates.<br><br>
<b>The program has been halted for new applicants until the impact of this incentive can be assessed.</b></p>

<p><b>Vehicle License Tax Reduction (bill):</b> HB 2228 makes hybrid motor vehicles eligible for the same reduced vehicle license tax as alternative fuel vehicles.

For all years after the first twelve months the MSRP is reduced by fifteen percent each year. Introduced and sent to Transportation, Appropriations, and Rules Committees 01/18/07, Second Read 01/22/07, Held 02/01/07. Provision removed before the final bill’s passage.</p>

<p><b>Vehicle License Tax Reduction (bill):</b> SB 1466 would reduce the annual vehicle license tax for vehicles that have the average MPG (arithmetic average of city and highway MPG), as established under federal guidelines, by the following amounts: 25 percent for a vehicle with an average MPG rating of at least 31 but less than 36. 50 percent for a vehicle with an average MPG rating of at least 36 but less than 41. 75 percent for a vehicle with an average MPG rating of at least 41 but less than 46. It sets the tax at $10 for a vehicle with an average MPG rating of 46 miles per gallon or greater. Reintroduction of SB 1466. Referred to the Finance, Rules, Appropriations, and Transportation committees 02/01/06.  Passed Transportation committee 02/14/06. No further action taken, bill did not pass.</p>

Eligible vehicles include the Toyota Prius, Honda Insight and Honda Civic hybrid. Vehicles must have a special California Clean Air Vehicle decal in order to use HOV lanes. For more information go to <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm"target=_blank">their web site</a>.</p>

<p>On Sept. 29, 2006, the Governor signed AB 2600, which increased the number of decals to  85,000.and extended the program to 2011. This legislation was somewhat controversial given the results of a California Department of Transportation report which found that some carpool lanes were becoming congested with hybrids, reducing the incentive to carpool. <b>Note: All 85,000 decals have been assigned</b>.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> On 08/30/2011 Governor Schwarzenegger approved SB 535 to extend the current Hybrid HOV program for six months. The Hybrid HOV program will expire on 07/01/2011. SB 535 also expanded the Hybrid HOV program to allow for another 40,000 decals for electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids. This program will begin in 01/01/2012 and expires on 01/01/2015.</p>

The law defines a converted plug-in hybrid electric vehicle as having a 75 percent increase or more in city fuel economy compared to the nonhybrid version for a minimum of 20 miles and is capable of recharging its battery from an on-board generation source and an off-board electricity source. For tax years commencing after 07/01/00, but prior to 01/01/10, the percentage of the incremental cost of the alternative fuel / hybrid technology covered by the tax credit would be determined by what emissions standard the vehicle meets (LEV, ULEV, or SULEV). For tax years commencing 01/01/10, but prior to 01/01/16, vehicles are broken into categories based on vehicle class and environmental performance that would determine the percentage of incremental cost covered by the tax credit.</p>

They include: a $2,000 personal income tax credit to individuals who purchase new hybrid, alternative flex-fuel vehicles to help defray the higher costs associated with the purchase of these vehicles; a new “Green” E-Z pass, which will provide a 10 percent discount for drivers of fuel-efficient vehicles, such as hybrids that average at least 45 MPG and meet certain EPA emissions standards, and;  new initiative will allow cars and other vehicles that average at least 45 mpg and meet certain EPA emissions standards to use HOV lanes in New York City and on the Long Island Expressway -- regardless of the number of occupants in the vehicle (the HOV portion of this initiative has been enacted--see "Clean Pass HOV" section above). These proposals will have to pass the New York legislature in order to take effect.</p>

<p><b>Nassau County Sales Tax Break and Vehicle Use Fee Waiver (bill):</b>  This bill, expected to pass soon, would provide a tax break on the county-portion sales tax on the cost of the hybrid's engine for the 2006-2007 models.

<p><b>"Green Car" Tax Incentives (Expired):</b> A 04456 extended the alternative fuel credits and amended the law to include tax credits for vehicles that were new electric vehicles, clean fuel vehicles, and vehicles that met the clean vehicle exhaust emission standards the state of California adopted. The law expired 12/31/06. Alternative Fuel (Clean Fuel) Vehicle Tax Incentive Program offered tax credits and a tax exemption for purchasing new hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), and/or installing clean fuel vehicle refueling equipment. Purchasers of qualified HEVs were eligible for a tax credit of up to $3,000, depending on the vehicle's fuel economy. The Toyota Prius and Honda Insight qualified. The maximum value of the incentive was $5,000 for vehicles weighing less than 14,000 pounds (lbs.) gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). The incremental cost of clean-fuel vehicles was exempt from state sales tax; this exemption expired February 28, 2004. These incentives applied to vehicles and fueling property placed in service by December 31, 2006.
