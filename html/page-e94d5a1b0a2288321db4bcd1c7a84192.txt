    <P><CENTER><EM><STRONG>Books just about station wagons are very
    rare. &nbsp; However, on 03/15/1998, a book exclusively about
    station wagons was published. It is written by Ron Kolwalke,
    automotive books editor for Krause Publications.</STRONG></EM></CENTER></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Ron described his book to me this way: 'It's
    hard for me to explain what Station Wagon &quot;the book&quot;
    is all about in just a few words. In writing this book I've tried
    to capture the nostalgia of the wagon as a vacation mule, as
    well as a sense of loss of the family-oriented vehicle that helped
    shape America in the 1940's to 1970's.'</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'The book has history going back to the 1920's.
    It has sections on wagons used in drag racing, wagons used by
    the railroad, and tons of funny stories from owners of wagons
    or from people who have childhood memories of their parents'
    wagons.'</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The book is called <EM>Station Wagon: A Tribute
    to America's Workaholic on Wheels</EM>. Click<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0873415671/5338-5280793-616531">
