        The clever little Morris Minor was a hit from the first time it was shown to the British
        public. Designed in the mid-Forties by Alec Issigonis, the Minor was introduced at the
        London Motor Show of 1948 sporting an up-to-the-minute unit constructed body, torsion bar
        front suspension, rack and pinion steering and a lower center of gravity achieved by using
        small 5.20 size tires on 14 inch wheels. This revolutionary design was on the cutting edge
        of small car development and years ahead of the prewar engineering that could be found
        under most of the European economy cars of the time. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Unfortunately, due to time
        and financial constraints, this ultra-new package came powered by a tried and true prewar
        Morris 918 cc flathead four and stump puller gearing instead of the 1000cc air-cooled,
        opposed, flat four that was planned for it. While the old Flathead proved adequate for the
        35-MPH average speed driven on the two lane secondary roads that could be found in England
        and most of the empire at the time, the early Series MM Minors found little favor here in
        the States. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In 1952, Nuffield Motors,
        the firm that built Morris cars, merged with Austin to form the British Motor Corporation
        (BMC). The Minor, now called the Series II model, acquired Austin's new 803 cc OHV four.
        Heavily promoted with lines like &quot;New Power For The Minor&quot; and &quot;0 to 50 mph
        in 28 seconds&quot;, the car became an English favorite and started to sell in the US as
        an economical &quot;second&quot; or &quot;shopping&quot; car. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">1957 brought an even more
        powerful 948 cc four, a better transmission and a curved undivided windscreen. America was
        experiencing a recession during the late '50s, and car buyers were starting to re-examine
        their &quot;bigger-is-better&quot; attitudes. Our first foreign car &quot;boom&quot; was
        on. Though the top three selling imports were the VW beetle, Renault Dauphine and the Ford
        Anglia, the little Morris had a lot going for it. Still perceived as a small car
        technology leader, the Minor 1000, as it now was called, inherited a somewhat &quot;sporty
        &quot; image from its MG and Austin-Healey brethren. The Morris also had the most
        extensive product line featuring both two and four door sedans, a convertible, a wood
        framed Traveller station wagon, a pickup, and a delivery van. In 1961, the Minor became
        the first British car to exceed 1,000,000 built. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The Morris 1000 continued,
        with only simple trim changes until it was pulled from the American market in 1962 due to
        lack of sales. Times had changed. The recession was over and our &quot;Big Three&quot; had
        introduced their own &quot;compact&quot; models. Though not nearly as economical as the
        imports, these cars provided the combination of a low purchase price and reasonable gas
        mileage with a larger size and flashy styling. Other than the VW and some sport and luxury
        models, foreign car sales were on the decline. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">By 1967, the American
        compacts had ballooned into &quot;mid-sized&quot; cars featuring V8 power with most of the
        toys found on luxury models. Did Mom need a 300 horsepower, 3500 pound sedan to drive to
        the market and the hairdresser? Foreign economy sedans, now called
        &quot;sub-compacts&quot;, were once again gaining popularity. The appeal of smaller, more
        agile and economical imports had increased to the point that even the Japanese had entered
        the market. Not to be left out, BMC re-introduced a now vastly improved Minor 1000. This
        car, with its new 1098cc motor, bigger brakes, better transmission, and higher rear end
        gearing provided relaxed freeway cruising and 42 mpg. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Over 1050 '67 Minors made
        it to these shores before BMC was forced to pull the plug again. This time, the 1968 EPA
        (smog) and DOT (safety) regulations would require all auto manufactures to re-engineer
        their products to comply and BMC decided to drop the importation of the Minor and put
        their efforts into the MG 1100/1300 sedan and the Austin America. The Minor continued in
        various forms overseas until mid-1971. Over 1.5 million were built by the end of
        production. In total, 65,000 were imported to the US between !949 and 1967. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>THE TRAVELLER WOODY</b> </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The Minor Traveller was
        introduced in 1954 as a Series II model. The unit construction floor and &quot;cab&quot;
        section was built at the main Morris plant at Cowley, then shipped to the MG factory at
        Abingdon to be fitted with the wood and aluminum rear &quot;doghouse&quot; structure. MG
        was just phasing out the wood frame bodied TF, to make way for the all-steel MGA, and
        their fully staffed woodshop was just the ticket for the Traveller woodwork. Always
        popular, the woodies were built beside the trucks until the end of production in 1971,
        while passenger car assembly ceased in 1969. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">This beautiful dark green
        1967 Traveller was purchased by former San Francisco City Supervisor, Bob Mendelsohn as a
        combination birthday and anniversary gift for his wife Ink. The Mendelsohns had moved to
        Washington DC to work with the Carter administration during the '70s and continued in
        related fields until moving back to the Bay Area a few years ago. Ink had been working at
        Smithsonian Magazine so it was only logical for her to want to go into the antique/gift
        business upon her return. Bob found this beauty while she was still back east packing. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The '67 had been totally
        restored in Yorkshire, England in 1984 and bought by Michael Freeman, an American
        engineer, while he was on work assignment in the UK. Mike brought the little car back to
        San Jose when his job was completed. He drove the woody for less than a year when he was
        re-assigned to the Denver area and the car went into storage in Union City, CA. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Bob Mendelsohn found out
        about the car from the local chapter of the Morris Minor Registry. He bought it and had it
        serviced and detailed before hiding it in the garage for the big surprise. Ink came home
        to San Francisco to find it wrapped in a yellow bow. She was ecstatic - Just the thing for
        her new business, Ideas Ink Inc. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The Classic Drive</b> </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Ink's Traveller is a super
        example of a Morris Minor. Tight and solid, it starts with the first twist of the key. The
        little mill hums like a sewing machine (and is about the same size) but growls through a
        sporty low restriction exhaust. First gear is very low, so you just get this puppy rolling
        - about halfway across the intersection, dump it into second and you're off! The Morris is
        quite tractable in the top three gears. It has adequate torque at the low end and you can
        buzz it up into the mid-fives. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">This car is fitted with
        Pirelli radials that seem to enhance the Minor's quick rack and pinion steering. In fact,
        the little woody nips in and out of traffic as well as a modern econobox and will blast
        down the coast highway like a sports car. There are some drawbacks. Steeper hills can
        become a problem for the small engine and require a lot of stick stirring and the brakes -
        well, they stop OK - but they are small drums and will fade after enthusiastic use. You
        learn not to overdrive them as they are not up to the Minor's level of the handling. On
        the freeway the Traveller will run right along with the rest of them, though the short 86
        inch wheelbase makes for a somewhat choppy ride and one must leave some room between your
        car and the one in front of you - remember those brakes. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">When you start to think
        about the negatives, you realize that you're comparing it to late model cars - not its
        contemporaries. Ever drive a swing axle VW, a deadly Dauphine, or an underpowered 3-speed
        Anglia? And consider that the Minor was designed in the mid-Forties! Even today, the 1967
        Minor is a remarkable car. <b>By Rick Feibusch © AutoWire.Net - San Francisco</b></font><font
