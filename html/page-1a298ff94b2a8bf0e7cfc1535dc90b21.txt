<h3>Proudly Designed, Engineered and Manufactured in the USA.  (red,white,blue USA 
flag logo) (per WeatherTech ad in Car & Driver mag May 2010)<br> 
".... So in 2007 we
transferred all of our floor mat
manufacturing back to the United States.
Today, we build the best fitting, highest
quality automotive floor mats in the world,
right here in America.
<br>     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Our machine shop is equipped with 17
CNC machining centers including four
4 axis mills and one 5 axis mill that
produce between 30 to 50 injection and
thermoforming molds per month. We
have one shift of highly skilled American
Journeymen toolmakers and apprentices,
but our machines run 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week. There is not a more efficient tool
and mold making operation in the world -
and guess what, itÂs right here in America.
<br>     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Furthermore, all of our CNC mills are
manufactured in Oxnard, CA by Haas. Our
1,000 ton injection molding machines are
made in Bolton, Ontario of American and
Canadian components. Our thermoforming
machinery is made in Carol Stream, IL. The
raw steel and aluminum billets which make
up our tooling are sourced from American
steel and aluminum mills such as Vista
Metals in Fontana, CA. The raw materials
that make up our All-Weather Floor Mats,
FloorLiners, Cargo Liners and Mud Flaps
are manufactured in Bellevue OH,
Arlington TX, Wichita KS and Jasper TN.
Our forklifts are made in Columbus IN
and Greene NY. Our warehouse racking is
manufactured in Tatamy PA.
Specialists in Original Equipment and
Aftermarket Automotive Accessories
<br>     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     At MacNeil Automotive, we are also very
aware of sustainability and our responsibility
to the environment. We are proactive in
controlling waste and recycling all of the
unused raw materials from the manufacture
of our tooling and products including:
aluminum, steel, rubber, TPO, TPE, paper
and cardboard.
<br>     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     As you can see, we are as dedicated to
designing, developing and manufacturing
the finest automotive accessories for our
consumer and OEM clients as we are
passionate about supporting the American
economy, preserving the American industrial
infrastructure, and keeping the ÂmoneyÂ in
our family, a family of 300 million people
from all over America.
<br>     

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Life is simple; be good to your fellow man,
be kind to animals and the environment, and
place building a quality product, supporting
your country and your fellow American
worker before profit. And, one last thing -
letÂs all do our best to balance family time
with work time as our children are the
future of America.
<br>     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Sincerely,
<br>
