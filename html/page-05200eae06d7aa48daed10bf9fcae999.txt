<h3>Cross Country Auto Shipping Guide</h3>
<p>Whenever you are in a situation where you need to use services to move vehicles long distances, it is important to have all the information available so you don’t get the wrong service or overpay for the services you do need. There are several key pieces of information you should gather before doing anything else. First, how many vehicles are you going to have moved? This is important because it may give you additional options on how to have them shipped. Secondly, you’ll want to know the types of cars you need moved. This is important because, for high value or very rare cars, you will most likely want more safety to be considered than a normal car. Of course, you’ll also need to know the starting point of the cars and the final destination at which they’ll arrive. Once you have all this information at hand, it’s time to contact a cross country vehicle shipping company to get everything arranged. <br /> <br />Working with professional <a href="http://www.a1autotransport.com/info/auto-transport-companies.php" title="car transport companies">car transport companies </a> is really the only way to go when you need to move cars across the country. It is not at all practical or financially wise to try to move your cars yourself, especially if you have more than one that will need to be transported. With all the extra miles you’d drive and the wear and tear on the cars, it’s really not advisable to try and arrange them all to be driven. Cross country auto transport services can load all your calls up on a car hauler and move them all in one trip which makes the entire process move much faster and more efficiently. The fact that all your cars are on one large truck actually saves a lot of money in fuel as well, since the car hauler is designed to move the heavy weight of cars efficiently.</p>
<h4>The Process</h4>
<p>When you are trying to find the best service, it’s very important to get a good list of the cars you need transported. The list should include the make and model along with the year and any aftermarket modifications. The more information you can provide, the better, because even small things can cause problems if the transporters don’t know about them ahead of time. They often need to load certain sized cars in specific locations on the truck, so they will have to have it all planned out before they start loading. This is especially true if the car hauler will have vehicles from other people on it as well, since they will want to fill the truck as much as possible. <br /> <br /><img class="caption" src="http://cdn.a1autotransport.com/images/stories/cross-country-vehicle-transport.jpg" border="0" alt="Cross country vehicle transport by A-1 Auto Transport" title="Cross country vehicle transport by A-1 Auto Transport" align="right" />When contracting a cross country auto transporter, you’ll want to mention if any of the vehicles are classic or rare cars since they can often provide extra protection for them. They may put these types of high value vehicles in an enclosed ship truck to ensure no damage occurs during the trip from loose stones on the road. Older cars also often have other special requirements based on the fact that they are so old. Things like parking breaks or transmissions are often different than more modern cars which can require special ways of securing the cars on the moving trucks. <br /> <br />If you know in advance that you will need to ship cars cross country, it is wise to try to make the arrangements as soon as possible. When there is more lead time to do the planning, you can often save money by booking the moving truck in advance. The company can take the fact that they know they need to be in your area on that date and plan other deliveries or pickups around that so they are sure their trucks will be full. This extra time can lead to quite a significant savings overall and it also eliminates the need for you to worry if you put it off to the last minute. <br /> <br />Another great way to try to save some money when using car shipping services is by being flexible. If you can be flexible on the dates and times which the transporters pick up and drop off the cars it can result in quite a bit of savings. They can schedule your deliveries based on when they will already have trucks in the area to do the moving. This way, they know they don’t have to make special arrangements to get a delivery truck to your location. While it may be inconvenient to have to wait for your cars to get delivered, it is often worth it to save some money. This is especially true if it is a car collection since you don’t really need to drive them on a daily basis. <br /> <br />One last tip which can lead to a much easier process and possibly some cost savings. If you’re using a service to take your cars to car shows around the country, you can possibly team up with other collectors. Working with another auto collector in your area to rent a car hauler together can be a great idea. Since you’ll be filling the entire car hauler between the two or more collectors you don’t have to worry about the transporters needing to make additional stops which can often delay the delivery. This is also great because it allows you to work with other collectors on this and possibly other projects which can be a great experience. <br /> <br />Whatever reason you have for needing to move your vehicles across the country, it’s important to take all these things into account. Having all the information needed well ahead of time and working to schedule the pickups and deliveries can save a lot of money along with eliminating the stress of waiting till the last minute. Just make sure, when using shipping services, to work out all the details ahead of time and you’ll be sure to have a successful move.
