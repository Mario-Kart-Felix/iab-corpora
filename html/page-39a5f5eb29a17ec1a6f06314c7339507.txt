 <br>http://www.ploughbooksales.com.au/<br>Plough Book Sales is a small part time business that deals in books relating to tractors, old engines, earthmoving equipment, live scale model making, steam power and metal working. We do not have a shop, although an appointment can be made to call and inspect the books. Because of the part time nature of the business it is some times hard to reach us by phone, please keep trying, you will eventually get through. <p>
We also do attend, and have stalls at some of the vintage machinery rallies and modelling exhibitions throughout Victoria. Please note that due to the large range of books and small demand for some items, it is not possible to keep all the books in stock all of the time. Delays of normally only 12 weeks but sometimes as long as 6 months or more can occur before a back order will be filled. <br><div><hr></div></FONT>
