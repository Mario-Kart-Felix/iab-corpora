    <TD colspan=2><P><B>I've always been a believer in motorcycle specific
    oils and believed the claims made by the manufacturers. Maybe
    I just wanted to believe their claims and that was enough for
    me. I've used Golden Spectro 20-50 synthetic petroleum blend for
    ten years and just couldn't find any fault with it. Then along
    came the Motorcycle Consumer News article in February of 1994
    and it appeared to disclaim everything I believed in. Although
    I read it, for some reason I just wasn't convinced (or maybe,
    once again, I didn't want to be convinced). During the next three
    years, I heard people talking about changing to Mobil 1 synthetic.
    But they never made any great claims, just that they switched.
    Was it better, or just cheaper at Wal-Mart? Well, this year I
    was determined to find out if Mobil 1 was actually as good or
    better than Golden Spectro in my own unofficial and crude seat-of-the-pants
    experiment.<BR>
    </B></TD>
  </TR>
    <TR><TD><P><B>I always change my oil in the spring right after
    a 5-10 mile warm-up ride, so this seemed the perfect time to try
    the Mobil 1. New Mobil 1, new filter, and out I went. No surprises,
    no changes in oil pressure or temperature (I use VDO gauges for
    both) and everything seemed OK. I drove the bike normally and
    noticed that shifting was a little more notchy, especially at
    low rpm's. <BR>
    </B></TD>
    <TD><IMG SRC="filterf.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="198"></TD>
  </TR>

    <TR><TD colspan=2><P><B>No big deal. This could just be attributed to my steady
    loss of memory as middle-age has its affect on me. I left the
    oil in for about one week before running the bike through four
    gears at 9,500 rpm's. What was wrong? It shifted OK at that rpm,
    but something was missing.It felt more like an automatic transmission
    than the &quot;Bang&quot; I would normally feel when hitting the
    next gear that hard. Tried another run, and the same thing. Then
    I remembered Kevin Sheard telling me that he tried Mobil 1 in
    his nitrous CBX and that the clutch would just spin whenever he
    hit the nitrous button. What's going on here? I went home, dumped
    the oil, filter and oil cooler and refilled the CBX with Golden
    Spectro 20-50. No more notchy shifting and a good snap when I
    released the clutch! Could there be something about this automotive
    synthetic when used in motorcycle transmissions/clutches that
    Motorcycle Consumer News didn't tell us?<BR>
    </B></TD>
  </TR>
    <TR><TD colspan=2><P><B>About this same time, three different independent
    articles appeared in national magazines about the dangers of the
    new automotive oils. So I decided to read the Motorcycle Consumer
    News article again to see if I missed something. The entire article
    seems to be obsessed with viscosity retention&quot; and gives
    very little importance to anything else. I also was confused about
    why MCN chose Mobil 1 synthetic against Spectro's regular petroleum
    oil. This didn't seem fair. MCN tested five oils: Mobil 1, Castrol
    Syntec (synthetic), Castrol GTX (petroleum), Spectro 4 (petroleum)
    and Honda HP4 (synthetic). The Mobil 1 and Castrol Syntec scored
    highest in viscosity retention. I felt that more digging was necessary.
    Some quotes from the MCN article:<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Claim - Since the introduction of catalytic
    converters in automobiles, the best anti-wear agents have been
    limited by law to the amount that can be used in automotive oils,
    but are present in greater concentration in motorcycle oils.&quot;
    <BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Fact - Phosphorous deteriorates the catalyst
    in converters and is therefore restricted to a very small percentage
    in automotive oils. Phosphorous is also an essential element in
    one of the best anti-wear agents, ZDDP (zinc dialkyldithiophosphate),
    which is a primary component in such over-the-counter engine additives
    as STP Engine Treatment.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;While it is true that slightly increased concentrations
    of ZDDP are found in some motorcycle oils (such as Spectro Products),
    it is also true that these concentrations still fall under the
    government limits.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B><I>[Now, motorcycle oils have more anti-wear agents
    than automotive oils because they clog the catalytic converter.
    Hang on to this thought, because we'll use it later - Tim]</I><BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Claim - Motorcycle engines run hotter and rev
    higher than automobile engines....<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Fact - This is one of those statements that
    was much more true in the 1970's than in the 1990's. The big,
    slow-revving Detroit automobile engines of the past have mostly
    been replaced with smaller, higher-revving four-cylinder and six-cylinder
    engines that have much more in common with their counterparts
    running on two wheels.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>[This is where I take great exception to MCN's ignorant
    assumptions. Show me one standard production automobile that produces
    150 horsepower per liter and revs to 14,000 rpm. Does MCN think
    that motorcycles stopped developing while automobiles continued?
    They make this foolish statement while printing the following
    contradictory claim - Tim]<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>Referencing an oil viscosity retention chart, the
    MCN states &quot;Comparing these figures to viscosity retention
    for the same oils when used in an automobile.. would indicate
    that motorcycles are indeed harder on oils than cars.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>They go on &quot;...the Castrol GTX sample at 800
    miles showed a relative viscosity of 0.722, meaning it had retained
    72.2 percent of its original viscosity...in the motorcycle.&quot;
    <BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Just for comparison sake, I also tested the
    viscosity drop of the Castrol GTX automotive oil after use in
    a 1987 Honda Accord automobile. At 3,600 miles of use, the Castrol
    GTX showed a relative viscosity of 91.8 percent.&quot;<BR>
    </B></TD></TR>
    <TR>
      <TD><P><B><I>[The bike runs 800 miles and retains 72.2%, while
      the car runs the same exact oil for 3,600 miles and retains 91.8%
      of its viscosity. Does this sound like a bike is harder on its
      oil and has special needs? This article was quickly becoming a
      testimonial to motorcycle specific oils rather than what it appeared
      to be the first time I read it. Viscosity retention seems to be
      the only interest of MCN and yet they compared an automotive synthetic
      against the leading motorcycle brand's petroleum! At this point,
      I believed that there had to be more to this oil story than MCN
      was telling us, But I didn't want to rely on the motorcycle oil
      companies since I also believed that they would say only what
      would benefit them. So I went back to the three independent articles
      for the unbiased data that was needed. - Tim]</I><BR>

    <TR><TD colspan=2><P><B>The first article on this subject was from Bill Heald,
    contributing editor of Rider Magazine. Bill states:<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;The oil you buy for your car is designed for
    automobile engines, and its additive packages reflect this. These
    days, the new American Petroleum Institute's &quot;SJ&quot; classified
    oils are especially formulated to help reduce internal friction
    in order to reach new corporate fuel economy standards. The additive
    packages in these oils are fine for your new Cadillac or Subaru,
    but in the quest to increase fuel economy and decrease emissions,
    they are getting away from chemistry that suits the high-temperature,
    high rpm conditions in motorcycle engines, particularly air-cooled
    ones.... The increased use of friction modifiers in this newest
    classification of automotive oils may also pose compatibility
    problems with wet clutches as well.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>Heald concludes by saying:<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;As to the question of whether you really need
    motorcycle oil, it's clear that the contents of the additive packages
    for car and motorcycle oils is predicated by different concerns.
    In the case of automobiles the latest lubricants are primarily
    designed to reduce internal friction and save fuel; whereas motorcycle
    oils are geared more toward handling high rpm loads while also
    operating in transmissions and wet clutches.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B><I>[This was starting to clarify some questions, but
    this was only one person's opinion. - Tim]</I><BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>The following excerpt is from an article in Motorcycle
    Cruiser magazine titled The Trouble with Automotive Oil:<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Traditionally, a new API standard meant that
    the oil offered greater protection for the engine or other clear-cut
    benefits, such as longer oil life. However, recent API standards,
    specifically SH and SJ take a different direction. The problem
    stems from the automakers' need to reduce the fuel consumption
    of their vehicles and to protect their catalytic converters. Government
    corporate fuel economy (C.A.F.E.) standards drive the requirement
    for oils that improve mileage. To reduce fuel consumption, automakers
    have moved toward oils with friction modifiers to reduce viscosity
    and friction. These so-called 'energy-conserving' oils have three
    levels of friction reduction.&quot;<BR>
    </B><P><B>&quot;To protect the catalytic converters (which
    by law must be guaranteed for 100,000 miles) automakers specify
    oils with little or no zinc or phosphorous, the most effective
    extreme-pressure (EP) and anti-wear additives.&quot;<BR>
    </B>

    <P><B>&quot;With the API, SH and the new SJ standard, automotive
    oils have begun to cause problems in motorcycle engines. Oils
    with friction modifiers cause slippage of clutches, starter clutches
    and back-torque limiters. In addition, transmission gear and camshaft
    wear, as well as pitting, have increased with the absence of antiwear
    and extreme-pressure additives.&quot;<BR>
    </B></TD></TR>

    <TR>
    <TD><IMG SRC=" dipstickd.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="202"></TD>
    <TD><P><B>Motorcycle Cruiser concludes with: &quot;Even some
    of the big oil companies, such as Castrol and Pennzoil acknowledge
    the situation by making motorcycle-specific oils. It's no longer
    wise to use current standard automotive oil in your motorcycle.
    The money you save on the oil purchase is lost in damage to your
    engine and drive-train.&quot;<BR>
    </B></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD colspan=2><P><B>Gordon Jennings of Motorcyclist magazine recently
    wrote on the subject in his article Energy Weenies Strike Again:
    <BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;...motor oils are supposed to do four important
    things: cool, seal, cushion and lubricate. The government now
    has effectively decreed that low fluid drag shall be more important
    than any of the other oil properties. I am concerned that reduced
    engine life will prove to be a side effect of compounding oils
    for low drag.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Automobile manufacturers.. have wrung about
    all the mileage increases they can get from improved combustion
    and mechanical friction reduction. So they now venture into what
    may be over-reliance on chemicals to satisfy miles-per-gallon
    targets of weenies who give no thought to miles per engine.&quot;
    <BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;I believe we have arrived at the point where
    motorcycles' motor oil requirements are not all met by the new
    oils made for cars. Some divergence appeared when the Feds limited
    levels of phosphorous compounds like zinc dialkyldithiophosphate
    in motor oils to avoid poisoning catalytic converters, which most
    motorcycles don't have.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;Most motorcycle clutches run in oil, which
    means the friction modifiers in the latest energy conserving motor
    oils could cause clutch slip. People have been worrying about
    lubrication-caused clutch slip for years, and I have been telling
    them it's a non-problem for just as long. Today I'm not so sure.
    Motorcycle manufacturers have begun to worry about the direction
    the latest general-use oils are taking, foreseeing clutch and
    other problems.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>&quot;...the motor oils of the recent past were superb.
    Those are the oils your motorcycle's manufacturer has recommended,
    and you can't get into trouble using them. But those oils are
    on their way to being things of the past, like leaded fuel, doomed
    by bureaucratic tunnel vision.&quot;<BR>
    </B>
    <P><B><B>Conclusion</B><BR>
    </B>
    <P><B>
    <UL TYPE=Disc>
      <LI>The development of new oils using friction modifiers
      that improve mileage in automobiles has created a problem for
      motorcycles. Perhaps automotive oils of a few years ago were acceptable,
      but the new SJ and SH in particular have motorcycle manufacturers
      worried. So worried, in fact, that representatives from Honda,
      Kawasaki, Yamaha and Suzuki participated in a SAE (Society of
      Automotive Engineers) study in May 1996 to evaluate the problem
      of friction modifiers and their effect on motorcycle engine performance
      and life.<BR><BR>


      <LI>It is now a fact that friction modifiers used
      to improve automobile mileage will cause slipping clutches. This
      is a problem for CBX owners because our engine clutches run in
      oil and our alternator is driven by a steel clutch that also is
      in a constant oil bath. A slipping engine clutch may be an annoyance,
      but a slipping alternator clutch means a reduction in charging,
      unusual noises and excessive wear.<BR><BR>


      <LI>There is no doubt that the synthetic or synthetic
      blends are far superior to a pure petroleum oil, Just make sure
      it's designed for a motorcycle.<BR><BR>


      <LI>The absence of zinc and phosphorous from automobile
      oils is for the preservation of catalytic converters. These are
      both extreme pressure additives that are a necessary part of motorcycle
      oils.<BR><BR>

      </B>
    </UL>
    <P><B>The final decision is yours. You may not have a problem
    now and feel quite content using automotive oils. But three independent
    magazines and the motorcycle manufacturers are all warning us
    that we could experience expensive problems down the road.
    <P>Me?
    <P>I don't want to take that chance.<BR>

    To the CBX Club,
    <BR>
    <BR>

    After reading your story on oil I thought I would offer up my experience
    in the area. In '77 myself and 3 buddies all purchased new RD400's.
    after a short while one of then got a set of pipes, making his quicker
    and faster than the rest. Be a reading buff I remembered a comparison of
    Mobil 1 to convention oil in Popular Science. After 100,000 miles the
    Mobil 1 auto engine after tear-down (oil was changed every 25k) clean,
    shiny, and the parts were within new car spec's. It also ran cooler due
    the friction loss. So I tried it in my RD. it worked great at first (+800
    rpm in 6th) and now my bike was quickest. But shortly my clutch started
    slipping. I replaced with a kit from Barnett, new plates and springs. I
    never had a clutch problem again. The bike was later heavily modified
    with professional help, it would and did outrun any 750 from that time
    period and never again required clutch work (but it was stolen in '81).
    <BR>
    <BR>

    In '78 after reading the Cycle story I got on a waiting list and
    eventually received one of the first "Glory Red" CBX's in SoCal. After
    a length break-in (I always held the belief that the rings may not
    properly seat when using a synthetic so I always use conventional oils
    for the first 3-5K miles. I have no proof of this but I follow it to this
    day.) As a precaution I upgraded the clutch prior to using Mobil 1. Being
    a crazy high performance loving 19 year old I hooked up with Dale Walkers
    HP performance and started fixing it up. ( 6 into 6 Denco's (loved them!)
    air-box mod's, Nitrous, suspension mod's (I like corners!), paint by
    Santini (he does funny cars now) etc..) <B><I>[John's CBX can be found in <A HREF="yercbx.html">Your CBX</A> - Webmaster]</I></B> I put a good 20K miles on in a
    year and a half. Never had any oil related problems. Unfortunately I was
    a 19 year old with out a good job so I lost it to the Bank!!! It was the
    worst time in my life.
    <BR>
    <BR>

    Anyway I'm  close to 40 now. I've  had many bikes since that CBX but none
    compare. I hope to pick up a clean red '79 in the next year or so at
    which point I will join your club. I found the oil story very informative
    and will use for reference. Keep up the good work.
