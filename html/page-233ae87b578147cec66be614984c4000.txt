                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Professional and dedicated nonprofessional auto restorers make every effort to use OEM material in their projects. Non-original material detracts from a restored vehicle aesthetically and, very often, financially. There are a number of reference manuals and corporate entities that are dedicated to identifying and supplying the correct fabrics for vehicles manufactured in the 1940s and, in many cases, even earlier.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">When Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler introduced their new car to the German public in 1896, it had onboard a device that remained an integral part of the engines for almost a century; the float-type spray carburetor. Their invention was preceded first by the rotary brush carburetor then the wick carburetor. The wick carburetor was an integral inspiration in Maybach and Benz' work; it was the first device ever to introduce fuel vapor to an internal combustion engine.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Though license plates serve a utilitarian purpose first and foremost, they also serve as miniature works of graphic art and tiny time capsules. Though once seen as a simple and necessary identification tag, plates from the 1960s and other eras have become coveted by enthusiasts and collectors.  As each American state has its own department of motor vehicles, the history and features &#8211; including design, issuing practices and numbering &#8211; of 1960s license plates vary depending on the state.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">After an air cooled engine has been in storage for a number of years, there are checks that you must make to ensure that the engine is able to fire up again. In most cases, the engine will be adequately protected from the elements if it is sealed and stored correctly -- that is, with the crankcase filled with fresh oil and all the fuel drained out of the fuel tank and carburetor.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Sandblasting seems like a straight-forward process: spraying abrasives to remove rust, clean or sand whatever you point your sandblaster at. But there's a lot more to it, just as there can be a lot to working with different sanders and sandpapers. Media blasting can be both art and science. Your choices hinge on the materials you're restoring and the results you want to achieve.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Cars in the early 20th century were part of a revolution in the personal transportation habits of millions of consumers. Cars of the 1900s and 1910s were luxury items, built for wealthy buyers. By the 1920s, Henry Ford and other automakers transformed the industry by mass-producing affordable vehicles for the average working man and woman. Technologically advanced cars from the 1930s ushered in the age of modern automobiles.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">You may have been tempted to restore a barn-find of a motorcycle or old car. Many of these vehicles are left by the wayside after accidents or engine failure and go into a status called "salvage title." Once repaired and made functional again, the vehicle title can be changed back to a normal status so the vehicle can be used on public roads. However, the process is bureaucratic and involves a bit of paperwork.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Cars that can be restored present a host of problems to potential owners, regardless of what condition that they are found in. From the simplest, most common old Chevrolet to a vintage Aston Martin, old cars all have quirks, and they're generally most agreeable to sharing those quirks once the intrepid restorer is already neck-deep in the restoration and unable to back away slowly.</p>

With the big-finned 1957 version leading the way and the 1955 and 1956 Bel-Air models gaining in popularity as time moves on. Complete restorations involve going through your car with a fine toothed comb and restoring or replacing each and every part until the car is in perfect working order and as close to perfect as possible aesthetically.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Restoring vintage automobiles like the 1946 Plymouth can bring a lot of satisfaction and pride for auto enthusiasts. Before you begin the restoration you project you need to decide on the purpose of the restoration. If you want to show the car, you will need to restore the car back to its original state or as close as possible; if you are restoring the car for pleasure then you can use non-original or model specific parts in the restoration process.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Installing wheel tubs -- wider wheel wells so your car can accommodate wider racing tires -- into a 1979 Camaro isn't appreciably different from installing wheel tubs into any other vehicle. They must still be welded into place, and they still require cutting the floor of the car. The 1979 Camaro only differs in that there is little trunk space in which to work. For applying traction at the race track, however, there's little that compares to having bigger, meatier tires fitted to a 1979 Camaro.</p>

These are standard tires that have a painted or rubber white rim surrounding the hub cap. If you want to make your own whitewall tires, you can do so rather easily with a basic white tire paint and the proper application process. Once finished, you can cruise around town with tires mimicking the real thing.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">The 1965 Mustang was first introduced by Ford Motor Co. in April of 1964. The early release date resulted in a longer than normal model year for the Mustang, as other 1965 Ford cars were not released until October of 1964. The rear window on the 1965 Mustang is mounted in rubber, which is covered by a stainless steel molding. The molding might need to be removed for repair, replacement or when the rear window needs to be removed or sealed.</p>

Available as both a sedan and wagon, It offered a fully equipped interior, six-cylinder carbureted motor (V-8 engines were optional) and a low entry cost. The short-wheelbase Dart became an instant success, outselling Dodge's own Polara and Matador models. It was also a favorite among taxicab companies who bought them to update their aging fleets. Dodge later gained popularity with the enthusiast market, releasing several high-performance variants.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Cargo vans made their debut in the early 1960s. They were not designed to be fashionable or glamorous but rather had a very utilitarian purpose -- namely, to carry cargo. Early vans appear antique to modern eyes, which many find appealing. For this reason, car collectors also eye vans from the 1960s with interest, turning them into hot rods and custom machines.</p>

                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">Hubcaps are steel or alloy disks that cover all or part of the center wheel. Usually decorative, these devices protect the wheel from minor damage and give it a finished look. Vintage hubcaps for cars from the 1940s to the 1970s can be difficult to find, and car restorers may find themselves in a difficult position because you can't buy most of these hubcaps from the manufacturer any more. As such, sellers of these hubcaps can charge quite a bit for them. If you have a hubcap, on or off the car, follow these steps to identify it.</p>

After years of modest success, the company was boosted by the appearance of a Mercury in the 1955 film "Rebel Without a Cause" starring James Dean. This commercial success continued into the 60s, as Mercury rolled out numerous memorable models.</p>

Whatever your motivations, determining the value of the truck is the first thing you will need to do. Figuring out the truck's maker, model and year will help you pinpoint how much it is worth. From there you can decide whether to try and restore it, sell it as is or simply have it hauled away to a junkyard.</p>

Chrysler Corporation, however, made these types of engines famous, and Chrysler motors with this design feature have had the name "Hemis" since shortly after their introduction in 1951. Their design feature allows for improved combustion effieciency and generates more power than conventional engines of similar displacement. The first Chrysler Hemi was the FirePower, first appearing in the Imperial and New Yorker in 1951. Chrysler would not trademark the name "Hemi" until several years later.</p>

They were produced in the 1910s and 1920s by as many as nine different companies, possibly 10 if you include Richland Mazda Light Co., which was a subsidiary of General Electric at the time.

Also known as the Jeep truck, its ruggedness made it popular among hunters, farmers and construction workers. The full-size pickup truck was manufactured from 1947 to 1965 by the Willys-Overland Motor company. The company changed its name to Kaiser-Jeep in 1963 and eventually became known as the Jeep Corp. in 1970. Over its lifetime, the Willys pickup was produced in various configurations, featuring several engines and minor exterior changes.</p>

The Jaguar XJ is one such vehicle. The XJ Series I was produced in the mid-1960s, modified into the "Series II" in 1973, then the "Series III" in 1979. This makes the 1983 XJ6 a Series III vehicle. Any specifications that apply to Series III vehicles as a whole will then apply to the XJ6.</p>

Frequently, years of use or storage have dulled or marred a once-pristine paint job and touch-ups or complete repainting may be required. The original colors of Ford's 1958 vehicle line can be recreated from old records maintained by Ford and the paint companies. These colors can be recreated to restore a vehicle and make it appear as new as the day it was purchased for the first time.</p>

The sound of your horn can be customized to your tastes just as much as the car itself.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">The Ford Model T was a automobile produced by the Ford Motor Company from 1908 to 1927. This vehicle is regarded as the first affordable automobile produced in the world. The Model T was one of the first cars to be produced using an assembly line, which in turn, cut down on cost and sped up production. It is commonly said that Henry Ford, the creator of the Model T, insisted that the vehicle only be available in black. This was true in the later stages of the vehicle's production; however, prior to 1914, the Model T was available in&hellip;</p>

Introduced in 1956, the first Mechanical Mules saw extensive use in the Vietnam War and several other military excursions until retired in the 1980s.</p>

Unlike unit-body cars, which used the structural strength of the body to largely eliminate the frame, the F-100 retained the full ladder-type frame, but made the bed and cabin one unit. This design was not popular, and for 1964 Ford returned to the separated-bed design, while leaving the styling of the truck otherwise unchanged.</p>

Produced as a limited specialty model in the 1950s and 1960s, it was second in Cadillac's lineup after the top-of-the-line Eldorado. In 1975 the Seville was reintroduced as a regular production vehicle, meant to be a smaller-sized, top-of-the-line vehicle. After the body was redesigned in 1980, the following several years brought few changes. Among the updates that the 1981 Cadillac Seville received were new memory seats and several exterior additions.</p>

Ford produced this V8 in a "flathead" configuration, casting the engine block as a single piece, with the engine's intake and exhaust valves residing inside the engine block itself, as opposed to an overhead valve configuration that fit the intake valves inside the heads. From 1932 to 1953, Ford produced three generations of this engine, until it discontinued it in favor of its "Y-block" 8-cylinder engine's overhead valve design.</p>

Since vehicles during the 1950s kept getting bigger and heavier, requiring bigger engines, the FE (Ford-Edsel) engine was created in 1958. The 332 and 352 V-8 engines were the first FE engine, but displacements of up to 428 cubic inches were produced in later years.</p>

This was also true for the 1950 models, so the convertible was regulated to the Series 62 nameplate only. The front wheel openings were partially skirted in 1950, giving the Cadillac a heavy look. This feature was continued in subsequent years well into the 1960s.</p>

Chevrolet was one of the leading manufacturers of muscle cars that were affected by this transformation. The company's cars slowly transformed into sedans and luxury cars aiming for driving comfort and security rather than performance.</p>

Cars built during these years were primarily designed to be practical. Look at your vintage car as a work of art or a treasure and keep it in top condition. When you know how to keep your vintage car in shape, you can sell it for top dollar or show your car in antique car shows.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Vintage cars are those built between 1918 and 1930, a product of the industrial revolution that followed the end of World War I. Such models as the Ford Model A, Cadillac V16, Jaguar XJ 6 and Fiat 500 were among the first to be mass produced. They also were the first with features common in modern cars: engines cooled by antifreeze and powered by octane fuel, and four-wheel brakes. Style features from the time included brass and chrome. Early cars were modernized with closed bodies. But when it comes to handling, they differ vastly from today's models.</p>

Ford resigned the car into a four-passenger model for 1958 and created the personal luxury market, a niche the Thunderbird filled until the end of its production years later. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Thunderbird stayed on three-year styling cycles. The 1959 models were not much different from the 1958 versions.</p>

He wanted a new vehicle that would cater to that segment of the buying public. Ford stylists came up with the Mustang, which looked nothing like any previous Ford. By using existing mechanical parts from the Falcon, Ford was able to offer the first Mustangs at affordable prices. The buying public responded by snapping up Mustangs by the thousands.</p>

A relatively light body powered by a strong V-8 engine made this car faster than most cars on the road. The 1934 Ford is a favorite among car collectors and people who enjoy restoring older cars. It was also in this era that Ford began producing different models during a single year--car buyers had 10 different types of 1934 Fords from which to choose.</p>

                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">The 1957 Golden Hawk was part of a series that represented Studebaker's sporty answer to the Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Thunderbird. Golden Hawks were produced from 1956 to 1958, as an evolution from the sleek 1953 to 1954 "Leowy coupe" two-door body design. The Concept Carz auto enthusiast website says Golden Hawks were distinguished by a squared-off raised egg crate chrome grille, raised squared-off trunk lid and the concave tail fins painted in contrasting colors on the 1957 to 1958 models.</p>

The color Goldenwood yellow with a black interior was only available in the Impala or SS during 1964, so this is a rare find. The base price of these cars ranged from $2,853 to $3,210. This was the first year that the Super Sport model was separate, thus making it easier to identify the vehicle.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Paint schemes have changed over the years as new styles replace older ones. Some paint colors fall out of fashion and are replaced year after year by new and trendier schemes. Even primary colors like red come in a huge variety of shades and hues. Restoring a red car from 1956 could mean choosing between cardinal red and matador red. You need a reference to the original paint to accurately restore your 1956 Chevy.</p>
