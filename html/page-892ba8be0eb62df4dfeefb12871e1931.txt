</SPAN>Our goal in designing this unit is to build an alternative energy electric drive unit that is affordable to everyone and that installation does not connect to or interfere with the operation of the vehicles standard gas power system. </FONT></FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000><FONT>This goal was reached first by using the unpowered rear axle area of front wheel drive vehicles.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This created an enormous market for our product immediately, according to a Department of Transportation and RITA (Research and Innovative Technology Administration) survey there are 137,078,843 passenger vehicles in the United States and 90% are front wheel drive.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Second we designed a complete electric drive axle unit that replaces the standard unpowered rear axle for easy installation.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>With this design we now could add plug-in rechargeable electric power to all new and used front wheel drive vehicles with little or no alterations to its original design.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The third and the most important were for this unit to be user friendly.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Two electrical switches were designed, one that went to the accelerator pedal that would allow it to move back and forth from electric power to the standard gas power system.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The second switch went to the shift lever; this allowed the vehicle just to be shifted into neutral for electric drive and back to drive or reverse to use the gas power system.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Next rechargeable battery packs were designed to use minimal trunk or vehicle space.</FONT></FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000><FONT>Our first patent was filed in June of 2008; it covered the entire idea that is described above.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The second patent that was filed in October of 2009; is more specific about how the electric drive axle and switches work and work together.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; There are two patent that were awarded in November of 2011, both are structural and address the way the electric motor is mounted on a front wheel drive vehicle. &nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000><FONT>With the Electric Vehicle as our competition we compared cost, availability, and performance.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The AED unit will retail from $3,000 to $6,000 depending on the model of vehicle, about one tenth the cost of an electric vehicle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The two biggest manufactures of the&nbsp;electric vehicle&nbsp;is the Chevrolet Volt Which plans on releasing to the public 10,000 vehicles in 2011.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Nissan is releasing 20,000 of their electric vehicles in 2011.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Our AED unit can be available to the public in&nbsp;1 year and at a cost that can be paid for with the savings from inexpensive electric power. </FONT></FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000><FONT>The market starting out is; according to the Department of Transportation, there are about 120 million front wheel drive vehicles on the road in the US today.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>At this time there is no aftermarket electric drive unit to compete with.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The electric vehicle being the closest to it, but at ten times the cost.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The EV manufactures are having their problems and no telling when they will ever be any competition.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>At this moment according to NBC news on December 31, 2010 the Chevrolet Volt with retail sales of 350 units and the Nissan Leaf has retail sales of 10 units.</FONT></FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000><FONT>When considering performance all should be equal.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Everybody is using the same battery technology and similar electric motors.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The big advantage that we have is the use of existing vehicles and that the AED can fit on any front wheel drive vehicle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>One difference will be is that the AED battery packs do not have to power safety and comfort features such as power brakes, power steering, air conditioning and heat.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>These features are powered by the idling of the gas motor while running on electric power.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000><FONT>Also one must take the time to decide what they would do if the AED unit was available and you were faced with the decision of whether to buy an EV or add electric drive to the vehicle you are driving.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There is another advantage with AED unit and that is that a complete charging system can be installed on the gas motor.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>With AED unit you have two separate sources of power and with the electric power equal to the performance of an EV.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=3>Want a solution to the ever increasing price of gasoline?&nbsp; Your commits are&nbsp;important&nbsp;and will help in bringing this product to the consumer.&nbsp; Please let me know what you think.&nbsp; Thanks, Joe<br /><span></span>In November of 2011 we did receive two patents from the U.S. patent office and have others still pending that involve switches, wiring and others that are structural.</FONT></FONT><br /><span></span><FONT color=#000000 size=3><br /><span></span>If you would like to be a part of this project or&nbsp;have any questions&nbsp;please email Joe Vargas.</FONT><br /><span></span><br /><FONT color=#000000 size=3><A title="" href="mailto:joevargas@autoedrive.com">joevargas@autoedrive.com</A></FONT><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><FONT color=#009900>Follow me on Twitter @DRIVE ELECTRIC<br /><span></span></FONT></h2>
