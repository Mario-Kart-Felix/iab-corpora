        <strong>Thoughts about hybrid cars:</strong><br />
        Do I think that hybrids are the answer for the world's energy problems? Simply and emphatically, No. We have a long way to go however hybrids are a step in the right direction. Research proves: hybrids aren't a load of bull. They save more energy than non-hybrids and they are fun to drive. There's a lot of misinformation circulating around out there about hybrids, but hopefully with time people will learn that hybrids do help the environment and your pocket. <br /><br />
  <strong>Low Resistance Tires</strong><br />
        Want to save fuel? Purchase a Hybrid or Toyota Prius and get as much as 50 miles per gallon, or you could change the tires on your current car and get five percent or more in better fuel economy. The key is low-rolling-resistance (LRR) tires, which are standard equipment on hybrid and electric cars, but rarely make it onto the average cars that most of us drive. The Department of Energy says 5 to 15% of fuel economy is used for overcoming rolling resistance. This is what Dot says; &ldquo;Rolling resistance is fundamentally the parasitic energy a tire consumes while rolling under load. The phenomenon is quite complex, and nearly all operating conditions can affect the final outcome. It is estimated that 5%-15% of light-duty fuel consumption is used to overcome rolling resistance for passenger cars. For heavy trucks, this quantity can be as high as 15%-30%&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        <a name="article-start" id="article-start"></a>Myths still surround <a href="http://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/how-do-hybrid-cars-work" target="_blank">hybrid cars</a>, so for that reason alone it is imperative to separate them from the facts. From the need for wall sockets to the inconvenience of fuel cells, the fact that there is so much negative gossip about hybrids is proof they are doing something right. People often have a hard time accepting change, especially when it involves something as sacred as what they think about automobiles. America has evolved around the car through the entirety of the last century, so it is understandable that many misconceptions about hybrids still exist. </p>
      <p><strong>5 Hybrid Myths</strong><br />
        <strong>Myth One: Hybrids Require expensive battery packs</strong><br />
        Fact: Modern hybrids use a system known as regenerative charging. Every time you apply the brake on your hybrid, the gas engine transfers a portion of electrical power back into the battery, thereby automatically recharging the battery. By keeping it charged between 40 and 60 percent of its maximum capability, hybrid batteries enjoy a long life, one that is guaranteed by some manufacturers up to 100,000 miles. Yes they will someday need servicing but they are not failing at the rate the nay sayers predicted.<strong><br />
  <br />
          Myth Two: Hybrids Have No Power.</strong><br />
        Fact: The performance level of hybrids is impressive. New technology allows many of the same attributes of high-powered vehicles to be applied in hybrids. The Lexus GS 450h has more than 300 horsepower and can beat many gas powered vehicles in a 0 to 60 road test. Just because hybrids are known for their fuel efficiency does not mean they are underpowered. The Prius will chirp tires.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Myth Three: Hybrids are Cost Prohibitive.</strong><br />
        Fact: The Toyota Prius starts at about $22,000--same with the Honda Civic <a href="http://www.carsdirect.com/hybrid-cars/how-to-buy-a-hybrid-car-online">hybrid</a>. It is true that hybrids can cost as much as $100,000 or more, but nobody seems to make the same complaint against gas powered cars even though a <a href="http://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/how-the-ferrari-formula-1-technology-influences-its-road-cars">Ferrari</a> might set you back $500,000. Like many of the myths surrounding hybrids, this is one that is completely unfounded and based more on fear of systemic change than on fact. Electric vehicles is another story.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Myth Four: Hybrids are the Cars of Bleeding Heart Liberals.</strong><br />
        Fact: Although branded with the stigma that hybrids or other AFVs were solely the possession of left-leaning, liberal-minded consumers, the truth simply proves this to be another false claim made on the basis of prejudice and fear of the new. While purchasers of hybrids may have primarily been liberals in the beginning, as the facts become known and the benefits praised highly, conservative drivers have jumped on board the hybrid bandwagon, as have auto workers, both of whom realize that fuel efficiency trumps simplistic bias any day. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Myth Five: Hybrids are the Cure-all for Foreign Oil Dependency.</strong><br />
        The fact is that hybrids, although they present a clear alternative to over-consumption of fossil fuels, do not solve all of America's problems when it comes to foreign oil however it is a great start!<br />
        The myths surrounding hybrids are slowly being erased, but as with much misinformation, it has a tendency to spread faster than the truth. The good thing about the facts, though, is that they will come out no matter how long it takes. As more people learn the truths are about hybrids, it will catch on.</p>
