          <blockquote class="summary description"><p>I was informed by my dealer that Strictly Diesel was a good choice for non warranty work a couple years ago. I took my vehicle into them to check on a few items including a FICM. After 3 days they informed me that I had 2 weak injectors and 2 that were about to get weak. So I let them change them along with the ficm. This should have taken a couple more days. It in fact took them 2 weeks to return my vehicle.

On a trip to California I broke down on the way home. On the return I was passing the 12000 mile warranty period. In fact it was 12,040 miles from the repair. As they had replaced 4 injectors I again took my truck to them for repair. After a week and a half they still had not even looked at the engine. They claimed that the dealer would not pay for the repair and I had to beg them to find out what was wrong with it. A week later they finally tore open the top end to find that I had lost 5 injectors. 4 of them are the ones they replaced 12,040 mils earlier!!! After being coerced into changing all of the injectors, I received another $5000 invoice. I questioned the labor portion knowing that manufacturers refund labor along with failed parts. I spent 6 years at the Napa warehouse dealing with them all the time. I was chastised by the counter help when I asked and was told they did not have to warranty the 4 injectors but were being nice. In all it took 3 and a half weeks to get my truck back.

I have not been back since and let everyone I meet know what kind of service they offer.</p></blockquote>
                   	         	<p class="shopResponse"><strong>Response:</strong> (4/20/12): We take customer service and warranty issues very seriously.  We're very sorry to hear that Robin is not happy about the work we performed, but we need to clarify a few facts.  From our records, the second invoice was only about $2100....nowhere near $5000.  We covered (4) injectors under warranty, and from the looks of it, we covered some of the labor for replacing those injectors (the labor charge for the injectors was significantly less than a full set of 8).  We were paid NOTHING by Ford in terms of labor.

I can't speak for the amount of time in the shop, it was just too long ago to even speculate.  There are a lot of factors that can affect this, some of them are out of our control (waiting for parts, waiting for customer approval to complete work, waiting for a free stall, etc).  We do our best to keep the shop flowing as smoothly as possible, but sometimes jobs take longer to start and/or finish than even we would like.

As for being "coerced" and "chastised", that is NOT acceptable or tolerated in any way.  The service advisor we had when Robin was last in our shop (08/2010) was let go a long time ago, for numerous reasons.  We currently have a fantastic staff of positive and motivated people who really care about our customers.  While there may have been some validity to Robins complaint about our "counter help" back in 2010, it most certainly does not apply to our current front counter staff!

Robin is clearly still unhappy with the last service visit in 2010, and while we don't expect to be taken up on the offer, we'd like to extend an invitation to give Strictly Diesel another chance.  We are positive that the improvements we've made in our staffing and customer service will be obvious and significant.

When initially trying to find out what the probem was at two separate Ford dealerships, they seam to give me the run around and couldn't say for sure. When I arrived in Phoenix about a year ago they told me exactly what the problem was as well as many things that had probably developed by the repair being neglected. My repair ended up being substantial, but diesels are expensive. I have since gone back for other upgrades and small maintenance issues with exceptional results. The staff is more than friendly and seems to treat everyone with respect, no matter what the question is. After using several other diesel shops including Ford dealerships, I will not go anywhere else. If you the work done right by the best in the business, this is shop hands down.</p></blockquote>

I started researching the 6.0 and came to realize it had several design flaws. Strictly Diesel has found a nice market in making the 6.0 a reliable motor. They installed, an after-market Oil Cooler, an aftermarket EGR cooler, they ported my heads and installed braided steel cooler lines in the areas that have hotspots. I had new headgaskets and longer head studs installed. They also installed a monitor, that gives me oil temp, engine temp, tranny temp, voltage and exhaust temp.
 The Ford gauges don't move until you have a serious problem, I was able to deduce early that I was loosing coolant, by watching the engine temps. It turned out the aftermarket EGR cooler had a bad wield. SD, fixed it free of charge. They where professional in explaining the things they where doing and why. They didn't try to hardsell me and when I did have a problem they stood behind their work. 
 Do I wish I didn't drop $15K on this upgrade, sure. Do I wish Ford had put out a reliable product without design flaws you bet. Am I glad someone is out that that could turn my truck back into something reliable again and not an expensive boat anchor yes. I would recommend Strictly Diesel, JLG.</p></blockquote>
