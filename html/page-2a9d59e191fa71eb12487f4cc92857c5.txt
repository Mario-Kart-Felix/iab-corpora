              For additional appraisers and inspectors see Hemmings Motor News, Old Car Weekly and all of the Trader Publications relating to collectible cars. While all the above have proved to be knowledgeable professionals, I do not endorse, recommend or suggest any of these agents and encourage you to call them or any other you may select, to find one that meets your need.<br>
              <br>
              Characteristically they perform an in depth inspection of the vehicle inside, outside, underside, photograph it and do a test-drive. They write written reports with digital photographs included then mail or e-mail them to you.<br>
              <br>
              The cost of their services varies, based on the distance they travel and time spent with vehicle. They start at approx. $125 for an inspection and verbal phone report to you, and go up from there if you wish a written report with photos. I assist them by making prompt appointments, day or night and offer lifts, tools, lighting or any other inspection equipment they may require.<br>
              <br>
              While this added expense to you may seem unnecessary, it is money well spent when the vehicle you acquire rolls off that delivery truck just as you had it described to you, and you will have no disappointments.</font></p></td>
