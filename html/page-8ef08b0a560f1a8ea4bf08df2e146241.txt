It can lower your gas mileage by 33 percent at highway    speeds and by 5 percent around town. Sensible driving is also safer for you    and others, so you may save more than gas money. </span></p>

        You can assume that each 5 mph you    drive over 60 mph is like paying an additional $0.24 per gallon for gas. <br />

        Avoid keeping unnecessary items in    your vehicle, especially heavy ones. An extra 100 pounds in your vehicle    could reduce your MPG by up to 2%.

            <strong>Avoid    Excessive Idling</strong> <br />
        Idling gets 0 miles per gallon.    Cars with larger engines typically waste more gas at idle than do cars with    smaller engines. <br />

      <strong>TIRES  - NASCAR vs. PASSENGER </strong><br />
      <strong>Top NASCAR tire specialist offers tips on how to better take care of your  tires</strong> <br />
  Watching NASCAR pit crews change  tires is one of the activities that most race fans take for granted. After all,  they change their own tires after 25,000 miles or so, not after 25 laps, right? <br />
  Well, the attention to detail that  pit crews pay to the tires on their cars is something that most motorists  should pick up on, according to Jerold Shires, the tire specialist for the No.  20 Home Depot Toyota driven by Tony Stewart for Joe Gibbs Racing. <br />
  Shires, who hails from Waiteville,  WV, recently took time out of his busy schedule at Talladega, to share some of  his expertise to help consumers get the most from their personal automobiles. <br />
  The most important thing that  consumers can do to keep their tires happy is to pay attention to the air  pressure, Shires said. <br />
  &ldquo;Passenger tires have an air  pressure rating, but most of the time it&rsquo;s a maximum,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;That  rating is for a full load. For our racing tires, we adjust them to make the car  handle.&rdquo; <br />
  Shires goes on to say that drivers  can do that on their car&rsquo;s tires as well for better handling, but that  consumers should mainly be concerned about load. <br />
  &ldquo;If it says to inflate to at least  32 pounds, you want to run it a couple of pounds under that so when the  pressure builds up, it will be right on the rating. If you run it at full  inflation, it will wear out the center of your tire.&rdquo; <br />
  Tire pressure is key to maintaining  the contact patch, or the amount of rubber that&rsquo;s actually on the road. Proper  tire inflation plays a significant role in fuel mileage as well, and that&rsquo;s  important in the days of $3.50 plus per gallon of gas. <br />
  &ldquo;If you run it low, it&rsquo;s more of a  drag on the tire,&rdquo; Shires cautioned. &ldquo;If you keep it at 30 pounds, say, for a  tire that&rsquo;s rated at 32 or 34 pounds maximum load, you&rsquo;ll be better off. The  more you keep the tire up off the road, the less drag you have on it and the  better your mileage will be.&rdquo; <br />
  Improper inflation causes the tires  to wear out quicker. You see it on the race track, too. Lower inflation means  better handling, but it also increases the chances that the tires will be the  victim of abuse and fail to perform. <br />
  Consumers need to &ldquo;read their tires&rdquo;  to keep them working well over their useful lives, Shires said. <br />
  &ldquo;The biggest thing to take care of  is the air pressure,&rdquo; Shires reiterated.&ldquo;If you let your tire get too low,  you&rsquo;re going to wear out the outside of the tire. If you put too much in it,  you&rsquo;ll wear out the center. Watch how your tires are wearing, too. It might be  air-pressure-related, but it might also be suspension related. Keep all four  tires at the same pressure, unless you have a sports car where the front and  back ratings are different.&rdquo; <br />
  By reading the tire&mdash;inside, center  and outside&mdash;you can tell if your air pressure is where it needs to be or if you  have a suspension or alignment problem. <br />
  &ldquo;If a tire is wearing on the inside,  closest to the hub, it&rsquo;s an alignment problem 90 percent of the time,&rdquo; Shires  said. &ldquo;It can also be a tie-rod or other suspension component, which changes  the degree of camber and produces tire wear. If it&rsquo;s air pressure, most of the  time it&rsquo;s worn on the inside and the outside. If you&rsquo;re at max inflation, it&rsquo;s  the center.&rdquo; <br />
  Finally, consumers need to watch the  depth of the tread on the tires. Goodyear Racing Eagles have, Shires said,  about 4/32nds of an inch of tread on them when they&rsquo;re new. <br />
  &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but  it gets the job done,&rdquo; Shires emphasized. <br />
  Passenger car tires come equipped  with wear bars all the way across the tire, and learning to read those is  useful. If you&rsquo;d rather do a quick measurement, Shires said all you need is a  cent&hellip; a penny that is. <br />
  Take the penny and put it in one of  the tread grooves, with Abe Lincoln&rsquo;s head facing down. <br />
  &ldquo;If the tread comes up past the  head, you&rsquo;re still good; if it&rsquo;s above the head of the penny, definitely get  new tires,&rdquo; Shires stressed. </span></p>

<p><span class="style70"><strong>Used Cars Advantages</strong> <br />
  Most people hesitate when it comes  to purchasing car, the most frequent question that they have being: should I  buy a new one or a used one? The choice is theirs but the essential thing is to  be aware of both possibilities and their advantages. Those of you who have  decided to purchase a used car made a smart choice, because you can get an  almost new car without having to suffer the depreciation a new car undergoes.  It is a fact that used cars are 20 or even 30 percent cheaper than the new ones  and that they will definitely help you save some money. <br />
  Used cars present several advantages  that are worth taking into consideration. First of all, buying a used car means  that you will be able to afford a more luxurious model. Next, you will save a  significant amount of money on insurance and finding a near new-car vehicle is  not that difficult and bargains are a possibility for those of you who are  smart shoppers. <br />
  Used cars considered a risk by some  people because of the lack of reliability and the expense of repairs. However,  these are old issues because nowadays used cars are more reliable than they  used too, some of them are still under factory warranty, most carmakers sell  certified used cars which have warranties, you can easily find out the history  of an used car and the financing rates for such cars have dropped considerably  these years. <br />
  Used cars purchasing is no longer a  risk but a good deal, as long as you know how to bargain and where to shop  from. Finding a great deal of a used car can be very rewarding from a financial  point of view. However, if you are having doubts regarding the condition of the  used vehicle you intend to purchase, we advise you to perform a vehicle check  that will reveal any potential problems. Thus, you will know exactly what you  are getting and how much you should pay for it. <br />
  Used cars are nowadays durable and  reliable due to manufacturers and engineers, having almost the same value as a  new car. Since new car prices are continuously growing, used cars are becoming  more appealing. Used car dealers can also put at your disposal certified used  cars, which have gained much popularity and can be found at most car dealers.  The most important benefit of certified used cars is the fact that you are  purchasing a car that has been checked out carefully and turned out to be in a  good condition, thus receiving an extended warranty. </span></p>
<p class="style70">Used car dealers will offer you certified  warranty for used cars only if it meets the highest standards set by the  manufacturer of the automobile. Furthermore, once you purchase such a car most  dealers will let you three days to see if the car is right for you. Other  benefits of certified used cars are roadside assistance, lower loan rates, free  of charge maintenance together with oil changes and inspections. <br />
  Used car dealers consider that the  most important benefit of such cars is the long time warranty that you receive  which is low cost and will help you save hundreds of dollars.

  Dealersdefinitely know their  business and in order to make a good deal for a new car, you must be very well  informed. The key to purchasing the car that you desire is doing the research  on the vehicle before talking to a dealer. Although it is hard to keep in mind  all the information you have gathered, the essential thing is to remember what  is most important. </p>
<p class="style70">New car dealers have a profit margin  somewhere between ten and twenty percent and this margin represents the  difference between the price they want you to pay and the invoice price. New cars  are quite appealing but they will definitely cost you a little bit more and in  case you don&rsquo;t find something you like in a car lot, you can always order it  but this will take time. <br />
  New car dealers can be quite  intimidating and they can talk you into purchasing something different than  your desire or even something far more expensive than what you had in mind, so  make sure you stick to your established budget, regardless of what they tell  you. Your emotions will definitely cost you money, so it is better not to  reveal how excited you are about new cars. <br />
  New cars must be chosen taking into  account the following things: your lifestyle, the place you live in, your  hobbies and last but not least, your income. The most essential thing is to  purchase a vehicle that suits your lifestyle and the weather and road  conditions. Furthermore, think about what you like doing when you are not home  or at work. Don&rsquo;t forget about remaining within the limits of the budget you  have established.<br />
  New car dealers will do their best  tom help you but they are also going to try to make you pay more. Thus, if the  car seems to have a cost-effective price, if you are not paying attention you  might end up paying more for the warranty or the other charges. Customers don&rsquo;t  know how much mark up there is on a particular warranty and dealers are aware  of that, thus making as much profit as they can. A solution would be purchasing  reliable extended warranties from other sources which offer a better price.<br />
  New cars alarms can also be over  priced, being a great opportunity to make profit, especially when the clients  are not familiar with the price of an alarm. New car dealers should be selected  carefully, because there is no point in paying more for an alarm whose value is  acceptable. Don&rsquo;t rely on what you are told as your only source of information  because doing a little homework before closing a deal will save you some money.<br />
  Buyers with information will get the  best deals and not researching loans and lease rates before visiting the dealer  will cost you precious money. Learn how to calculate your payments and how to  be able to tell a good price from a bad one. New cars will have a reasonable  price, once you don&rsquo;t pay for the things you don&rsquo;t have too such as delivery,  promotion, handling, sales charges, etc. however, you&rsquo;ll have to pay for taxes,  registration, licenses and destination charges.</p>
<p class="style70">If you are not satisfied with the  offer presented by the dealer, you are always free to walk away and look for  more convenient deals. You don&rsquo;t need to feel ashamed of trying to make a good  acquisition. This being said, you can go ahead and shop around for the car of  your dreams.</p>

  Nothing lasts forever;  any car eventually will start having problems. However, while some cars may  provide you with few hundred thousands miles of trouble-free driving, others  start having problems from the beginning. Why there is such a huge difference?<br />
  <br />
  Sometimes cars start having problems after accidents. Sometimes it may be a  factory defect or design flaw. Heavy conditions like, for example, driving only  short trips without letting the engine to warm up fully also make the engine  life shorter. <br />
  <br />
  Corrosion is another factor - for example, park the car for a few months in  place with high humidity and later it will probably have more problems than the  vehicle driven all this time on daily basis. <br />
  Yet, lack of maintenance is one of the most often reason for a car to break  down. </p>

<p class="style70">Here is a visual  example:<br />
  Compare these two images: the engine on a top photo hasn't been maintained  well. Looks like it the engine oil hasn't been changed for long time. This  engine has relatively low mileage and already needs serious and costly repair.  The engine on the lower photo has been maintained well. After 175,000 miles  (281,000 km) it's still in a very good condition, and needs no repair at all.  Can you see the difference? <br />
  So, what's most  important to keep your engine in a good shape? <br />
  - I guess, I won't say  something new stating that regular oil changes is most important factor to keep  the engine running. If you do it more often than suggested by manufacturer's  schedule, that's even better. <br />
  <br />
  - Avoid overheating the engine<br />

<p class="style70">The automatic  transmission is one of the most complicated and thus one of the less reliable  parts of the vehicle. The repair of an automatic transmission is complex and  tends to be quite expensive. More than that, automatic transmission problem can  make your car unsafe - some transmission defects may cause, for example, that  the car can roll with the shifter in Park or drive forward with shifter in  Neutral. On the other hand, if taking a good care of, your transmission can  last you really long with no significant problems.<br />
    <br />
  You may find some simple tips how to prevent your automatic transmission from  damage and keep it in a good shape. It doesn't require too much of your efforts  - just periodical checking and regular maintenance. <br />
  <em><br />
    Tip: Have you looked in your vehicle owner's manual? Try, it's a best source of  information on your vehicle maintenance. You will be amazed how many useful  info you may find in this book! </em> </p>
<p><span class="style70"><strong>What can damage your automatic transmission</strong> <br />
  Most of the transmission  troubles start from overheating. Under heavy load, such as towing a heavy  trailer, rocking the vehicle from the snow, having continuous stop and go  traffic in hot weather, racing, etc. the transmission overheats. At higher  temperatures the transmission fluid burns, losing its lubricating qualities and  becomes oxidized leaving deposits all over inside the transmission. Exposed to  the heat the rubber seals and gaskets inside the transmission become hardened  causing leaks. The metal parts warp and lose their strength. All this, sooner  or later, results in transmission failure. For example, I read a story about a  persons that burned the transmission when he was spinning the wheels too hard  trying to free his shiny Audi from the snow on the next day after he bought it!<br />
  <br />
  However, overheating is not the only reason - sometimes transmission breaks  down because of poor design, due to lack of maintenance or after being rebuilt  by inexperienced technician. Few other reasons: harsh driving, too low or too  high transmission fluid level or wrong transmission fluid type - a person I  know added gear oil into the automatic transmission... guess, what happen? -  the transmission died after 40 minutes of driving! <br />
  <br />
  <a name="prevent" id="prevent"></a><strong>How to prevent the  transmission from damage</strong> <br />
  - Regularly check your  parking space for leaks. Doesn't matter, is it the engine oil leak, power  steering fluid or transmission fluid; if you discover any, get it fixed before  it caused something serious.<br />
  <br />
  - Once in a while check the transmission fluid level and condition. Not all  cars however have the automatic transmission dipstick, in some cars, for  example, in late Volkswagen models, the transmission fluid can only be checked  by the dealer. Consult with your owner's manual for details. If the  transmission fluid level is too low, there is a leak somewhere that needs to be  fixed. <br />
  <br />
  - Change the fluid as often as it said in your owner's manual or when it  becomes too dark (rather brown than red) or dirty.<br />
  Also, keep in mind that an automatic transmission can not be drained completely  - there is always some transmission fluid left inside the transmission (the  torque converter, in the valve body, etc.) which means you only can change  about %60 of the fluid at once. This is one more reason to change it more  often. <br />
  <br />
  - Use only the same type of the transmission fluid as specified in the owner's  manual or on the dipstick. Some vehicles (e.g Dodge Caravan) are very sensitive  to fluid type<br />
  <br />
  - Never shift to the Reverse or Parking until the car comes to a complete stop.<br />
  <br />
  - Never shift from the Parking mode when engine rpm is higher than normal idle.<br />
  <br />
  - Always hold a brakes down when shifting from Parking.<br />
  <br />
  - The automatic transmission can be damaged if towing with the drive wheels on  the road. Always use a dolly or place powered wheels on the towing platform (if  the vehicle is front wheel drive - tow it from the front leaving rear wheels on  the road. <br />
  <br />
  <a name="overdrive" id="overdrive"></a><strong>How to use overdrive</strong> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td class="style70"><br />
      Generally speaking, overdrive    (O/D) is the highest gear in the transmission. On most cars the automatic    transmission has 3 speeds and Overdrive (forth speed). Overdrive allows the    engine to have less rpm with higher speed in order to have better fuel    efficiency. When you switch it on, you allow the transmission to shift into    overdrive mode after the certain speed is reached (usually 30 - 40 mph    depending on the load). When it's off, you limit transmission shifting by    third speed.<br />
      <br />
      In normal driving condition the overdrive should be always on.<br />
      You may need to switch it off when driving in mountainous area or towing a    trailer.<br />
      <em>[The automatic transmission automatically shifts from OD to the 3-th gear    when it feel more load. When it feels less load it shifts back to the O/D,    but under certain conditions, e.g: driving uphill or towing a trailer, the    transmission can not decide to stay in OD or to shift into 3-th speed and it    starts to shift back and forth. That's the time you may switch it off and    help the transmission to decide.] </em>.<br />
      <br />
      You also may need to switch it off when you want to slowdown using the engine    braking, for example, driving downhill. <em>[For more details, check your owner's    manual] </em> </td>

    <a name="service" id="service"></a><strong>Servicing your  transmission</strong> <br />
  I'd recommend to go for  a service to your car make dealer - they have original parts, they know exactly  what type of the fluid to use and their technicians are highly trained to  service particular vehicle model. Even if you go to the independent garage,  always ask to use original parts - sometimes, the after-market parts are not of  as good quality as original. <br />
  <a name="transmissionshop" id="transmissionshop"><br />
  </a><strong>When it's time to go to  the transmission shop</strong> <br />
  If you experience any  problems with your transmission such as leaks, noises, problems with shifting,  etc. - don't wait until the problem will become worse and car will finally stop  somewhere on a highway, visit your trusted local transmission shop. Automatic  transmission problems never disappear by themselves. Also, when going for the  repair, try to explain to service person more detailed - what exactly problem  you experience, when it happens, what does it look like. It will be easier for  them to repair the transmission. Before going to the transmission shop for the  repair ask them about the warranty - the longer warranty they will give you,  the better will be the repair. </p>

<p class="style70"><a name="What_Is_An_Auto_Mechanic" id="What_Is_An_Auto_Mechanic"></a>WHAT DOES AN AUTO MECHANIC DO? <br />
  An auto mechanic (or motor mechanic  in Australian English) is a mechanic who specialises in automobile maintenance,  repair, and sometimes modification. An automobile repair shop (also known as a  garage) is a place where automobiles are repaired by auto mechanics. A mechanic  may be knowledgeable in working on all parts of a variety of car makes or may  specialize either in a specific area or in a specific make of car. In repairing  cars, their main role is to diagnose the problem accurately and quickly. They  often have to quote prices for their customers before commencing work or after  partial disassembly for inspection. The mechanic uses both electronic means of  gathering data as well as their hands, ears, eyes and nose. Their job may  involve the repair of a specific part or the replacement of one or more parts  as assemblies.Basic vehicle maintenance is a fundamental part of a mechanic's  work in some countries, while in others they are only consulted when a vehicle  is already showing signs of malfunction. Preventative maintenance is also a  fundamental part of a mechanic's job, but this is not possible in the case of  vehicles that are not regularly maintained by a mechanic. One misunderstood  aspect of preventative maintenance is scheduled replacement of various parts,  which occurs before failure to avoid far more expensive damage. Because this  means that parts are replaced before any problem is observed, many vehicle  owners will not understand why the expense is necessary.With the rapid  advancement in technology, the mechanic's job has evolved from mechanical to  electronic technology. Because vehicles today posses complex computer and  electronic systems, mechanics need to have a broader base of knowledge than in  the past. Lately, the term &quot;auto mechanic&quot; is being used less and  less frequently and is being replaced by the euphemistic title &ldquo;automotive  service technician&rdquo;. Fading quickly is the day of the 'shade tree mechanic',  who needed little knowledge of today's computerized systems. Due to the  increasingly labyrinthine nature of the technology that is now incorporated  into automobiles, most automobile dealerships now provide sophisticated  diagnostic computers to each technician, without which they would be unable to  diagnose or repair a multitude of common failures.<strong>Education</strong><br />
  In the United States, several programs and schools that offer training for  those interested in pursuing competencies as an automotive mechanic or as an  auto technician already exist. A few of the aspects usually taught those  studying for this career are: powertrain repair and diagnosis, emissions, and  suspension. Most mechanics are ASE certified, which is a standardized method of  testing skill level. The National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation  (NATEF) is responsible for evaluating technician training programs against  standards developed by the automotive industry and recommend qualifying  programs for certification. NATEF certifies programs in four different  categories: automotive, auto body, trucks (diesel technology) and alternative  fuels. Automotive Youth Educational Systems (AYES) is a non-profit partnership  of automotive manufacturers, dealers, and high schools/tech prep schools that  aims to encourage young people to consider careers in retail automotive  service, and prepare them for entry-level career positions or advanced studies  in automotive technology. The technology used in automobiles changes very  rapidly and the mechanic must be prepared to learn these new technologies and  systems. The auto mechanic has a physically demanding job, often exposed to  temperature extremes and well as lifting heavy objects and staying in  uncomfortable positions for extended periods as well as exposure to gasoline,  solvents and other toxic chemicals. <br />
  <a name="What_Is_An_Automobile_Breakdown?" id="What_Is_An_Automobile_Breakdown?"></a>WHAT IS AN AUTOMOBILE BREAKDOWN? <br />
  A vehicle breakdown is the  mechanical failure of a motor vehicle in such a way that the underlying problem  prevents the vehicle from being operated at all, or impedes the vehicle's  operation so much, that it is very difficult, nearly impossible, or else  dangerous to operate. Vehicle breakdowns can occur for a large number of  reasons. Depending on the nature of the problem, the vehicle may or may not  need to be towed to an automobile repair shop.<strong>Total breakdown </strong><br />
  A total breakdown is when the vehicle becomes totally immobile and cannot be  driven even a short distance to reach a repair shop, thereby necessitating a  tow. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including complete engine  failure, or a dead starter or battery, though a dead battery may be able to be  temporarily resolved with a jump start. When a total breakdown occurs, the  motorist may be able to have the service paid for by a roadside assistance  plan. This may be available through an organization like AAA, the vehicle's  manufacturer, the vehicle insurance policy, or in some cases, another service  the driver subscribes to, such as a mobile phone carrier.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Partial breakdown </strong><br />
  In a partial breakdown, the vehicle may still be operable, but its operation  may become more limited or more dangerous, or else its continued operation may  contribute to further damage to the vehicle. Often, when this occurs, it may be  possible to drive the vehicle to a garage, thereby avoiding a tow. Some common  causes of a partial breakdown include overheating, brake failure, or frequent  stalling. With other problems, the driver may be able to operate the vehicle  seemingly normally for some time, but the vehicle will need an eventual repair.  These include grinding brakes, rough idle (often caused by the need for a  tune-up), or poor shock absorption. Many vehicle owners with personal economic  difficulty or a busy schedule may wait longer than they should to get necessary  repairs made to their vehicles, thereby increasing damage or else causing more  danger. <br />
  <a name="What_Is_A_Hybrid_Vehicle?" id="What_Is_A_Hybrid_Vehicle?"></a>WHAT IS A HYBRID VEHICLE?<br />
  A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct  power sources to propel the vehicle.[1] Common power sources include: *  On-board rechargeable energy storage system (RESS) and a fueled power source  (internal combustion engine or fuel cell) * Air and internal combustion engines  * Human powered bicycle with electric motor or gas engine assist * Human-powered  or sail boat with electric power The term most commonly refers to  Hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) which include internal combustion engines and  electric motors.<strong>Environmental issues </strong><br />
  The hybrid vehicle typically achieves greater fuel economy and lower emissions  than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), resulting in  fewer emissions being generated. These savings are primarily achieved by four  elements of a typical hybrid design: 1. recapturing energy normally wasted  during braking etc.; 2. having significant battery storage capacity to store  and reuse recaptured energy; 3. shutting down the gasoline or diesel engine  during traffic stops or while coasting or other idle periods; 4. relying on  both the gasoline (or diesel engine) and the electric motors for peak power  needs resulting in a smaller gasoline or diesel engine sized more for average  usage rather than peak power usage. These features make a hybrid vehicle  particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops,  coasting and idling periods. In addition noise emissions are reduced,  particularly at idling and low operating speeds,[2] in comparison to  conventional gasoline or diesel powered engine vehicles. For continuous high  speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Hybrid types by engines</strong><br />
  <strong><br />
    Hybrid-electric petroleum vehicles</strong> <br />
  When the term hybrid vehicle is used, it most often refers to a Hybrid electric  vehicle. These encompass such vehicles as the AHS2 (Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon,  and Saturn Vue), Toyota Prius, Toyota Camry Hybrid, Ford Escape Hybrid, Mercury  Mariner Hybrid, Honda Insight, Honda Civic Hybrid and others. A  petroleum-electric hybrid most commonly uses internal combustion engines  (generally gasoline or Diesel engines, powered by a variety of fuels) and  electric batteries to power electric motors. There are many types of  petroleum-electric hybrid drivetrains, from Full hybrid to Mild hybrid, which  offer varying advantages and disadvantages.<br />
  <strong><br />
    Continuously Recharged Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)<br />
  </strong>Given suitable infrastructure, permissions and vehicles BEVs can be  recharged while the user drives. The BEV establishes contact with an  electrified rail, plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached  conducting wheel or other similar mechanism (see Conduit current collection).  The BEV's batteries are recharged by this process - on the highway - and can  then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged. This  provides the advantage, in principle, of virtually unrestricted highway range  as long as you stay where you have BEV infrastructure access. Since many  destinations are within 100 km of a major highway, this may reduce the need for  expensive battery systems. Unfortunately private use of the existing electrical  system is nearly universally prohibited. The technology for such electrical  infrastructure is old and, unfortunately outside of some cities, is not widely  distributed. Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs can be  funded, in principle, by toll revenue, gasoline or other taxes. <strong>Hybrid fuel  (dual mode)</strong><br />
  In addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for propulsion,  some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy input types  (&quot;fuels&quot;) using the same tank and engine to be hybrids, although to  avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms,  these are perhaps more correctly described as dual mode vehicles: * Some  electric trolleybuses can switch between an on board diesel engine and overhead  electrical power depending on conditions (see dual mode bus). In principle,  this could be combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug-in hybrid  trolleybus, although as of 2006, no such design seems to have been announced. *  Flexible-fuel vehicles can use a mixture of input fuels (petroleum and  biofuels) in one tank &mdash; typically gasoline and bioethanol or biobutanol, though  diesel-biodiesel vehicles would also qualify. Liquified petroleum gas and  natural gas are very different from each other and cannot be used in the same  tanks, so it would be impossible to build an (LPG-NG) flexible fuel system. *  Some vehicles have been modified to use another fuel source if it is available,  such as cars modified to run on autogas (LPG) and diesels modified to run on  waste vegetable oil that has not been processed into bio-diesel. * Power-assist  mechanisms for bicycles and other human-powered vehicles are also included. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Plug-in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (PHEV)</strong><br />
  The latest wrinkle in the rapidly evolving hybrid technology is the plug-in  Hybrid Electrical Vehicles--PHEV. In this gasoline electrical hybrid its  battery pack is upgraded with a larger capacity battery pack (usually Li-ion)  that is recharged by both a battery charger hooked into the electrical grid and  the gasoline engine only if required. The car runs on battery power only for  the first 10 to 60 miles [16-100 km] with the gasoline engine available for  faster acceleration etc. After the battery is nearly fully discharged the car  reverts to the gasoline engine to recharge the battery and/or return the car to  the charging station. This may get around the fundamental obstacle that has  killed nearly all pure electric cars--the typical battery pack can carry about  as much energy as 1-2 gallons of gas. Fuel costs (ignoring conversion costs),  in principle, may be as low as 5 cents/mile. Its not clear yet whether  converting an existing hybrid car will ever pay for itself in fuel  savings--yet. The biggest problem is finding a good, cheap high energy battery  pack--the same problem that has plagued the pure electrical car. If everyone  plugged into the utility grid to charge up their car this would seem to be  merely displacing the gasoline/diesel combustion problem to the typical coal  powered electrical generating plant. But, if cars were recharged late at night  this would allow the base load of the electrical system to be more efficient  with a much more even base load and electrical power can also be generated by  clean nuclear, wind, hydro, tide etc, power. Since most travel is about 30  miles/day this may be the cleanest personal transportation system presently  available. There are a &quot;cottage&quot; conversion industry, several large  auto industry groups (GM, Toyota, Mercedes etc.) and &quot;serious&quot;  studies by the Department of Energy investigating this system. There are no  large car maker's cars for sale--yet (late 2007). The typical  &quot;cottage&quot; industry car &quot;converted&quot; is a Toyota Prius (at  $5k-$40k) since it is a full hybrid with enough power in its electrical system to  maintain typical city speeds. AFS Trinity Power's Extreme Hybrid(TM)  demonstrator (built by Ricardo Plc) was recently unveiled at the North American  International Auto Show. <br />
  <a name="About_A_Deisel_Engine" id="About_A_Deisel_Engine"></a>ABOUT A DEISEL ENGINE?<br />
  A diesel engine is an internal combustion engine which operates using the  Diesel cycle. Invented in 1892 by German engineer Rudolf Diesel, it was based  on the hot bulb engine design and patented on February 23, 1893. A diesel  engine uses compression ignition, a process by which fuel is injected after the  air is compressed in the combustion chamber causing the fuel to self ignite. By  contrast, a gasoline engine utilizes the Otto cycle, in which fuel and air are  mixed before entering the combustion chamber and then ignited by a spark  plug.Patent controversy <br />
  While Rudolf Diesel is credited with the invention the diesel engine, Herbert  Akroyd Stuart and Charles Richard Binney had already patented a compression  ignition engine designed to run on coal dust. The credit for the invention thus  hinges on whether compression ignition or oil fuel is considered the defining  property. Diesel's patent (No. 7241) was filed in 1892.[1] However, Herbert  Akroyd Stuart and Charles Richard Binney had already obtained a patent (No.  7146) in 1890 entitled: &quot;Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion  of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air&quot; which described the  world's first compression-ignition engine.[2] Akroyd-Stuart constructed the  first compression-ignition oil engine in Bletchley, England in 1891 and leased  the rights to Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons, who by July 1892, five years before  Diesel's prototype, had a diesel engine working for Newport Sanitary Authority.  By 1896, diesel tractors and locomotives were being built in some quantity in  Grantham. Importantly, Diesel's airblast injection system did not become part  of subsequent &quot;diesel&quot; engines. From around 1910, manufacturers  building diesel engines under patent from MAN began building engines with  'solid' injection systems, where fuel is delivered to the cylinder by a high  pressure jerk-pump rather than compressed air. This system was invented by  Herbert Akroyd Stuart and used on Ruston-built oil engines. MAN continued to  build engines to Diesel's original design into the 1920s. By this time Robert  Bosch had developed the spring-loaded fuel injector, which provided greater  accuracy than the simple nozzle of earlier systems. All mechanical-injection  diesel engines built from the 1920s onwards used some form of jerk-pump and  spring-nozzle injection. No engine has been built to Diesel's original design  since the 1930s.<strong>How diesel engines work<br />
  </strong>In mechanical terms, the internal construction of a diesel engine is  similar to its gasoline counterpart&mdash;components such as pistons, connecting rods  and a crankshaft are present in both. Like a gasoline engine, a diesel engine  may operate on a four-stroke cycle (similar to the gasoline unit's Otto cycle),  or a two-stroke cycle, albeit with significant dissimilarity to the gasoline  equivalent. In both cases, the principal differences lie in the handling of air  and fuel, and the method of ignition. A diesel engine relies upon compression  ignition to burn its fuel, instead of the spark plug used in a gasoline engine.  If air is compressed to a high degree, its temperature will increase to a point  where fuel will burn upon contact. This principle is used in both four-stroke  and two-stroke diesel engines to produce power. Unlike a gasoline engine, which  draws an air/fuel mixture into the cylinder during the intake stroke, the  diesel aspirates air alone. Following intake, the cylinder is sealed and the  air charge is highly compressed to heat it to the temperature required for  ignition. Whereas a gasoline engine's compression ratio is rarely greater than  11:1 to avoid damaging preignition, a diesel's compression ratio is usually  between 16:1 and 25:1. This extremely high level of compression causes the air  temperature to increase to 700 to 900 degrees Celsius (1300 to 1650 degrees  Fahrenheit). If a piece of steel wire to be heated to that level it would glow  cherry red. As the piston approaches top dead center (TDC), fuel oil is  injected into the cylinder at high pressure, causing the fuel charge to be  atomized. Owing to the high air temperature in the cylinder, ignition instantly  occurs, causing a rapid and considerable increase in cylinder temperature and  pressure (generating the characteristic Diesel &quot;knock&quot;). The piston  is driven downward with great force, pushing on the connecting rod and turning  the crankshaft. When the piston nears bottom dead center the spent combustion  gases are expelled from the cylinder to prepare for the next cycle. In many  cases, the exhaust gases will be used to drive a turbocharger, which will  increase the volume of the intake air charge, resulting in cleaner combustion and  greater efficiency. The above sequence generally describes how a diesel  operates. However, there are striking differences between the four-stroke and  two-stroke versions:<strong>Four-Stroke </strong><br />
  The cycle starts with the intake stroke, which begins when the piston is near  top dead center. The intake valve is opened, creating a passage from the  exterior of the engine (generally through an air filter assembly), through the  intake port in the cylinder head and into the cylinder itself. As the piston  moves toward bottom dead center, a partial vacuum develops, causing air to  enter the cylinder. In the case of a turbocharged engine, the air is rammed  into the cylinder at higher than atmospheric pressure. As the piston passes  through bottom dead center, the intake valve closes, sealing the cylinder. The  compression stroke begins as the piston passes through bottom dead center and  starts upward. Compression will continue until the piston approaches top dead  center. The power stroke occurs as the piston reaches top dead center at the  end of the compression stroke. At this time, fuel injection occurs, resulting  in combustion and the production of useful work. The final stroke is the  exhaust stroke, which begins as the piston approaches bottom top dead center  following ignition. The exhaust valve in the cylinder head is opened and as the  piston starts upward, the spent combustion gases are forced out of the  cylinder. Near top dead center the intake valve will start to open before the  exhaust valve is fully closed, a condition referred to as valve overlap.  Overlap produces a flow of cooling intake air over the exhaust valve,  prolonging its life. Following the completion of the exhaust stroke the cycle  will begin anew. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Two-Stroke </strong><br />
  Intake begins when the piston is near bottom dead center. Air is admitted to  the cylinder through ports in the cylinder wall (there are no intake valves).  Since the piston is moving downward at this time, aspiration due to atmospheric  pressure isn't possible. Therefore a mechanical blower or hybrid turbocharger  (a turbocharger that is mechanically driven from the crankshaft at low engine  speeds) is employed to charge the cylinder with air. In the early phase of  intake, the air charge is also used to force out any remaining combustion gases  from the previous power stroke, a process referred to as scavenging. As the  piston passes through bottom dead center, the exhaust valves will be closed  and, owing to the pressure generated by the blower or turbocharger, the  cylinder will be filled with air. Once the piston starts upward, the air intake  ports in the cylinder walls will be covered, sealing the cylinder. At this  point, compression will commence. Note that exhaust and intake actually occur  in one stroke, the period during which the piston is near the bottom of the  cylinder. As the piston rises, compression takes place and near top dead  center, fuel injection will occur, resulting in combustion, driving the piston  downward. As the piston moves downward in the cylinder it will reach a point  where the exhaust valves will be opened to expel the combustion gases.  Continued movement of the piston will expose the air intake ports in the  cylinder wall, and the cycle will start anew. Note that the cylinder will fire  on each revolution, as opposed to the four-stroke engine, in which the cylinder  fires on every other revolution. <strong>Cold weather and diesels </strong><br />
  In cold weather, diesel engines can be difficult to start because the mass of  the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, thus  preventing ignition. Spark ignition engines undergo the same problem, though  they have the added benefit of a spark plug to help cause ignition. The main  reason diesel engines take a long time to warm up in cold weather is the lack  of a throttle. Spark ignition engines are throttled, so only the right amount  of air comes in at a time. This is less efficient, but spark plugs only work  near the stoichiometric, or the proper ratio of air to fuel for complete and  most efficient combustion, mixture of fuel and air. Diesel engines accept a  cylinder full of air and measure in the right amount of fuel. So each time the  intake valve on a diesel opens, a full charge of cold air enters the cylinder.  This cools the cylinder back down. The heat gained from each explosion  therefore can only cause a gain in temperature that is much, much smaller than  it would be in a spark ignition engine.Some engines use small electric heaters  called glow plugs inside the cylinder to help ignite fuel when starting. Some  even use resistive grid heaters in the intake manifold to warm the inlet air  until the engine reaches operating temperature. Engine block heaters (electric  resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are often  used when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour) in  cold weather to reduce startup time and engine wear. In the past, a wider  variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as Detroit Diesels  and Lister-Petter engines, used a system to introduce small amounts of ether  into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Sabb marine engines and Field  Marshall tractors (amongst others) used slow-burning solid-fuel 'cigarettes'  which were fitted into the cylinder head as a primitive glow plug. Lucas  developed the 'Thermostart', where an electrical heating element was combined  with a small fuel valve. Diesel fuel slowly dripped from the valve onto the hot  element and ignited. The flame heated the inlet manifold and when the engine  was turned over the flame was drawn into the combustion chamber to start  combustion. The most extreme cold-starting system was probably that developed  by International Harvester for their WD-40 tractor of the 1930s. This had a  7-litre 4-cylinder engine which ran as a diesel, but was started as a petrol  engine. The cylinder head had valves which opened for a portion of the  compression stroke to reduce the effective compression ratio, and a magneto  produced the spark. An automatic ratchet system automatically disengaged the  ignition system and closed the valves once the engine had run for 30 seconds.  The operator then switched off the petrol fuel system and opened the throttle  on the diesel injection system. Such systems fell out of favour when electrical  glow plug systems proved to be the simplest to operate and produce.  Direct-injection systems advanced to the extent that cold-starting systems were  not needed and then electronic fuel injection systems rendered most cold-start  system unnecessary.Diesel fuel is also prone to &quot;waxing&quot; or  &quot;gelling&quot; in cold weather, terms for the solidification of diesel oil  into a partially crystalline state. The crystals build up in the fuel  (especially in fuel filters), eventually starving the engine of fuel and  causing it to stop running. Low-output electric heaters in fuel tanks and around  fuel lines are used to solve this problem. Also, most engines have a  &quot;spill return&quot; system, by which any excess fuel from the injector  pump and injectors is returned to the fuel tank. Once the engine has warmed,  returning warm fuel prevents waxing in the tank. Fuel technology has improved  recently so that with special additives waxing no longer occurs in all but the  coldest climates. A vital component of all diesel engines is a mechanical or  electronic governor, which limits the speed of the engine by controlling the  rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled  and a diesel engine without a governor can easily overspeed, resulting in its  destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the  engine's gear train. These systems use a combination of springs and weights to  control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. Modern, electronically  controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery and limit the maximum rpm by  use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The  ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters  such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and  controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through electric or  hydraulic actuators to maximize power and efficiency and minimize emissions.  Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a  key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the  engine. The timing is usually measured in units of crank angle of the piston  before top dead center (TDC). For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel  injection when the piston is 10 degrees before TDC, the start of injection, or  timing, is said to be 10&deg; BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design  as well as its speed and load. Advancing the start of injection (injecting  before the piston reaches TDC) results in higher in-cylinder pressure and  temperature, and higher efficiency, but also results in elevated engine noise  and increased oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions due to higher combustion  temperatures. On the other hand, delayed start of injection causes incomplete  combustion, reduced fuel efficiency and an increase in black exhaust smoke, containing  a considerable amount of particulate matter (PM) and unburned hydrocarbons  (HC).<strong>Advantages and disadvantages versus spark-ignition engines</strong><br />
  Power and fuel economy Diesel engines are more efficient than gasoline (petrol)  engines of the same power, resulting in lower fuel consumption. A common margin  is 40% more miles per gallon for an efficient turbodiesel. For example, the  current model &Scaron;koda Octavia, using Volkswagen Group engines, has a combined  Euro rating of 38 miles per US gallon (6.2 L/100 km) for the 102 bhp (76 kW)  petrol engine and 54 mpg (4.4 L/100 km) for the 105 bhp (78 kW) diesel engine.  However, such a comparison doesn't take into account that diesel fuel is denser  and contains about 15% more energy by volume. Although the calorific value of  the fuel is slightly lower at 45.3 MJ/kg (megajoules per kilogram) than  gasoline at 45.8 MJ/kg, liquid diesel fuel is significantly denser than liquid  gasoline. When this is taken into account, diesel fuel has a higher energy  density than petrol; this volumetric measure is the main concern of many  people,[attribution needed] as diesel fuel is sold by volume, not weight, and  must be transported and stored in tanks of fixed size. Adjusting the numbers to  account for the energy density of diesel fuel, one finds the overall energy  efficiency of the aforementioned paragraph is still about 20% greater for the  diesel version, despite the weight penalty of the diesel engine. When comparing  engines of relatively low power for the vehicle's weight (such as the 75 hp VW  Golf), the diesel's overall energy efficiency advantage is reduced further but  still between 10 and 15 percent.<br />
  <br />
  While higher compression ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines  are much more economical than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and  at engine idle. Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve  (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes at idle. This creates parasitic  drag on the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol/gasoline engines at  idle. Due to their lower heat losses, diesel engines have a lower risk of  gradually overheating if left idling for long periods of time. In many  applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left  idling unattended for many hours or sometimes days. These advantages are  especially attractive in locomotives (see dieselization). Naturally aspirated  diesel engines are heavier than gasoline engines of the same power for two  reasons. The first is that it takes a larger displacement diesel engine to  produce the same power as a gasoline engine. This is essentially because the  diesel must operate at lower engine speeds.[5] Diesel fuel is injected just  before ignition, leaving the fuel little time to reach all the oxygen in the  cylinder. In the gasoline engine, air and fuel are mixed for the entire  compression stroke, ensuring complete mixing even at higher engine speeds. The  second reason for the greater weight of a diesel engine is it must be stronger  to withstand the higher combustion pressures needed for ignition, and the shock  loading from the detonation of the ignition mixture. As a result, the  reciprocating mass (the piston and connecting rod), and the resultant forces to  accelerate and to decelerate these masses, are substantially higher the heavier,  the bigger and the stronger the part, and the laws of diminishing returns of  component strength, mass of component and inertia &mdash; all come into play to  create a balance of offsets, of optimal mean power output, weight and  durability.<br />
  <br />
  Yet it is this same build quality that has allowed some enthusiasts to acquire  significant power increases with turbocharged engines through fairly simple and  inexpensive modifications. A gasoline engine of similar size cannot put out a  comparable power increase without extensive alterations because the stock  components would not be able to withstand the higher stresses placed upon them.  Since a diesel engine is already built to withstand higher levels of stress, it  makes an ideal candidate for performance tuning with little expense. However,  it should be said that any modification that raises the amount of fuel and air  put through a diesel engine will increase its operating temperature which will  reduce its life and increase service requirements. These are issues with newer,  lighter, high performance diesel engines which aren't &quot;overbuilt&quot; to  the degree of older engines and are being pushed to provide greater power in  smaller engines. The addition of a turbocharger or supercharger to the engine  greatly assists in increasing fuel economy and power output, mitigating the  fuel-air intake speed limit mentioned above for a given engine displacement.  Boost pressures can be higher on diesels than gasoline engines, due to the  latter's susceptibility to knock, and the higher compression ratio allows a  diesel engine to be more efficient than a comparable spark ignition engine.  Because the burned gases are expanded further in a diesel engine cylinder, the  exhaust gas is cooler, meaning turbochargers require less cooling, and can be more  reliable, than on spark-ignition engines. The increased fuel economy of the  diesel engine over the gasoline engine means that the diesel produces less  carbon dioxide (CO2) per unit distance. Recently, advances in production and  changes in the political climate have increased the availability and awareness  of biodiesel, an alternative to petroleum-derived diesel fuel with a much lower  net-sum emission of CO2, due to the absorption of CO2 by plants used to produce  the fuel.<br />
  <br />
  The two main factors that held diesel engine back in private vehicles until  quite recently were their low power outputs and high noise levels,  characterised by knock or clatter, especially at low speeds and when cold. This  noise is caused by &quot;piston slap&quot;, the sudden ignition of the diesel  fuel when injected into the combustion chamber slamming the cold-contracted  piston into the cylinder wall. The tolerances between the piston and cylinder  wall are greater at cold temperatures to allow expansion at higher  temperatures. A combination of improved mechanical technology (such as  two-stage injectors which fire a short &quot;pilot charge&quot; of fuel into  the cylinder to warm the combustion chamber before delivering the main fuel  charge) and electronic control (which can adjust the timing and length of the  injection process to optimise it for all speeds and temperatures) have  partially mitigated these problems in the latest generation of common-rail  designs. Poor power and narrow torque bands have been helped by the use of  turbochargers and intercoolers.Emissions <br />
  Diesel engines produce very little carbon monoxide as they burn the fuel in  excess air even at full load, at which point the quantity of fuel injected per  cycle is still about 50% lean of stoichiometric. However, they can produce  black soot (or more specifically diesel particulate matter) from their exhaust,  which consists of unburned carbon compounds. This is often caused by worn  injectors, which do not atomize the fuel sufficiently, or a faulty engine  management system, allowing more fuel to be injected than can be burned  completely in the available time. The full load limit of a diesel engine in  normal service is defined by the &quot;black smoke limit&quot;, beyond which  point the fuel cannot be completely combusted; as the &quot;black smoke  limit&quot; is still considerably lean of stoichiometric it is possible to  obtain more power by exceeding it, but the resultant inefficient combustion  means that the extra power comes at the price of reduced combustion efficiency,  high fuel consumption and dense clouds of smoke, so this is only done in  specialised applications (such as tractor pulling) where these disadvantages  are of little concern. Likewise, when starting from cold, the engine's  combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat out of  the cylinder in the compression stroke. The result is that fuel is not  combusted fully, resulting in blue/white smoke and lower power outputs until  the engine has warmed through. This is especially the case with indirect  injection engines, which are less thermally efficient. With electronic  injection, the timing and length of the injection sequence can be altered to  compensate for this. Older engines with mechanical injection can have manual  control to alter the timing, or multi-phase electronically-controlled glow  plugs, that stay on for a period after start-up to ensure clean combustion &mdash;  the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent them burning  out. Particles of the size normally called PM10 (particles of 10 micrometres or  smaller) have been implicated in health problems, especially in cities. Some  modern diesel engines feature diesel particulate filters, which catch the black  soot and when saturated are automatically regenerated by burning the particles.  Other problems associated with the exhaust gases (nitrogen oxides, sulfur  oxides) can be mitigated with further investment and equipment; some diesel  cars now have catalytic converters in the exhaust. <br />
  <strong>Power and torque </strong><br />
  For commercial uses requiring towing, load carrying and other tractive tasks,  diesel engines tend to have better torque characteristics. Diesel engines tend  to have their torque peak quite low in their speed range (usually between 1600  &ndash; 2000 rpm for a small-capacity unit, lower for a larger engine used in a  truck). This provides smoother control over heavy loads when starting from  rest, and, crucially, allows the diesel engine to be given higher loads at low  speeds than a petrol engine, making them much more economical for these  applications. This characteristic is not so desirable in private cars, so most  modern diesels used in such vehicles use electronic control, variable geometry  turbochargers and shorter piston strokes to achieve a wider spread of torque  over the engine's speed range, typically peaking at around 2500 &ndash; 3000 rpm.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Reliability </strong><br />
  The lack of an electrical ignition system greatly improves the reliability. The  high durability of a diesel engine is also due to its overbuilt nature (see  above) as well as the diesel's combustion cycle, which creates less-violent  changes in pressure when compared to a spark-ignition engine, a benefit that is  magnified by the lower rotating speeds in diesels. Diesel fuel is a better  lubricant than gasoline so is less harmful to the oil film on piston rings and  cylinder bores; it is routine for diesel engines to cover 250,000 miles (400  000 km) or more without a rebuild. Unfortunately, due to the greater  compression force required and the increased weight of the stronger components,  starting a diesel engine is a harder task. More torque is required to push the  engine through compression. Either an electrical starter or an air start system  is used to start the engine turning. On large engines, pre-lubrication and slow  turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimize the amount  of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military  diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge, called a Coffman starter,  which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the  past, Caterpillar and John Deere used a small gasoline pony motor in their  tractors to start the primary diesel motor. The pony motor heated the diesel to  aid in ignition and utilized a small clutch and transmission to actually spin  up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an International Harvester design  in which the diesel motor had its own carburetor and ignition system, and  started on gasoline. Once warmed up, the operator moved two levers to switch  the motor to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very  complex cylinder heads, with their own gasoline combustion chambers, and in  general were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken  (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off). As mentioned  above, diesel engines tend to have more torque at lower engine speeds than  gasoline engines. However, diesel engines tend to have a narrower power band  than gasoline engines. Naturally-aspirated diesels tend to lack power and  torque at the top of their speed range. This narrow band is a reason why a  vehicle such as a truck may have a gearbox with as many as 18 or more gears, to  allow the engine's power to be used effectively at all speeds. Turbochargers  tend to improve power at high engine speeds, superchargers do the same at lower  speeds, and variable geometry turbochargers improve the engine's performance  equally (or make the torque curve flatter). </p>

  By purchasing a used  car, you can save a lot of money. A new car depreciates quickly in the first  few years and after 3 years, it is worth only about 60-70% of the original  price. In fact, as soon as you leave the dealership, your new vehicle is  suddenly worth $1000-$2000 less. It&rsquo;s true in general, a new car requires less  maintenance in first few years and most of the problems occurred within the  original warranty coverage period will be covered by the car manufacturer. Yet,  buying a new car does not always mean the buyer will get perfection. A new car  may come with problems associated with poor design or manufacturing defects  that may have been already repaired during the warranty coverage period if it's  a used car. The same is true for all kinds of recalls and service campaigns. <br />
  <br />
  Buying a used car is still a bit of a gamble - there is no guarantee that the  car is accident-free, has real mileage, and was properly maintained. There may  be some hidden problems like a worn out automatic transmission, or engine  problems that may not have been obvious when you test-drove the car.  Maintenance costs are higher for a used car and manufacturer's warranty may be  already expired. However, used cars are more reliable these days and there are  number of ways to reduce the risks associated with used car buying. You can  check the used car history records at CARFAX Records Check.<br />

  <br />
  If the car qualifies, you can buy an extended warranty to protect yourself from  unexpected repair costs. You also can opt for a manufacturer-certified used  vehicle - many manufacturers now offer late model used cars under Certified  Pre-owned programs where they inspect and recondition qualified used cars and  often provide an additional warranty coverage with them. <br />

  <a name="dieselorpetrol" id="dieselorpetrol"></a><strong>Considering  a car with Diesel engine</strong> Cars with a diesel engine consume almost half as  much fuel as the same car with a gasoline engine. However, there is a price to  pay: Diesel engines are a bit noisier and there always will be that not very  pleasant smell from the exhaust. Some Diesel engine vehicles require only  synthetic oil which means higher maintenance cost. There are only few passenger  cars with Diesel engine currently available in North America: Volkswagen and  Mercedes-Benz. However, with constantly improving Diesel technology and growing  fuel prices more cars may come. <br />
  <a name="engine" id="engine"></a><strong>Four-cylinder or six </strong>Four-cylinder engines usually  provide better fuel economy, but V6 and V8 engines generally have more power  and little more durability. The V6 (or V8) engine will be a good choice if you  want to use your car for towing a trailer. For normal city driving, a  four-cylinder engine will do the job. <br />
  <strong>Gas or Hybrid / Electric Car</strong> <br />
  The advantages of a hybrid or electric vehicle  are they don't have a transmission (the most complicated part of a gas engine).  Hybrids usually have better gas milage, better acceleration and a smoother  ride. Hybrids get better gas milage in the city than on the highway. Many times  hybrids and electric vehicles can drive in carpool lanes with just one person  in the vehicle. However hybrids cost more money right now than the equivalent  gas vehicle. The sheer popular demand of hybrids has allowed Toyota to surpass  GM as the largest car company in the world.<br />
  <br />
  In the future, hybrid costs will most likely change after more and more get  produced. The hybrid vehicles with the invention of bigger batteries will be  able to get easily over 50 to 100 miles. As the battery sizes increase it will  make the total electric vehicle more feasable to where one might possibly get  600 miles per charge. <br />
  <a name="asis" id="asis"></a><strong>Is it worth to buy a car 'as is'? </strong>I wouldn't advice to buy such a car even if the  price seems to be very cheap and here is why:<br />
  Usually used car like this needs a lot more repairs than it may seem at the  first look. Just a fresh example:<br />
  A friend of mine bought twelve years old Honda 'as is. It was drivable, but  &quot;minor body repair&quot; was needed. It was very cheap though - only  $1200. During the safety test more problems were discovered and he had to spend  another $600 for the brakes and suspension. To pass emission cost him $350 more  for new catalytic converter and tune-up. Body repair added $500 on the top. And  after one week of driving another problem came up - no compression in one of  the cylinder. Another $700 flew away. Finally the total cost came to almost  $4000 (plus new audio system, battery, etc.) and no one knows what and when  will be broken next because usually once the car starts having problems, it  never ends. <br />
  For this money, he could buy much better car in perfect condition certified and  emission tested with no hassles and headaches. As a conclusion I'd suggest you  to look not for the cheapest car available, but for a decent vehicle for  reasonable price. </p>

              <p>Irvine borders Tustin    and is an incorporated city in Orange County, California, United States. It    is a planned city, mainly developed by the Irvine Company since the 1960s.    Formally incorporated on December 28, 1971, the 69.7 square mile (180.5 km&sup2;)    city has a population of 202,079 (as of 2007). It has annexed in the past an    undeveloped area to the north, and has also annexed the former El Toro Marine    Corps Air Station, most of which is to be made into a park called the Orange    County Great Park. Currently, Irvine is larger in land area than any other    city in Orange County because of its annexation of the southern and eastern    unincorporated areas. In June 2007, it was named The Safest City in the    United States (Irvine has held the title since 2005) <br />
                Irvine is home to the    University of California, Irvine (UCI), the Orange County Center of University    of Southern California, and the Irvine Campus of Alliant International    University, Concordia University, California State University Fullerton,    Pepperdine University and Irvine Valley College.<br />

        <p class="style70"><strong>HISTORY OF IRVINE</strong><br />
          Evidence of early campsites and rock shelters in the  undeveloped parts of the city puts prehistoric man in the Irvine area at least  12,000 years ago. Irvine was inhabited by the Gabrielino Indians about 2,000  years ago. Gaspar de Portola, a Spanish explorer, came to the area in 1769.  This brought on the establishment of forts, missions and herds of cattle. The  King of Spain parceled out land for missions and private use. After Mexico's  independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government secularized the  missions and assumed control of the lands. It began distributing the land to  Mexican citizens who applied for grants. Three large Spanish/Mexican grants made  up the land that later became the Irvine Ranch: Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana,  Rancho San Joaquin and Rancho Lomas de Santiago. In 1864, Jose Sepulveda, owner  of Rancho San Joaquin sold 50,000 acres (200 km&sup2;) to Benjamin and Thomas Flint,  Llewellyn Bixby and James Irvine for $18,000 to resolve debts due to the Great  Drought. In 1866, Irvine, Flint and Bixby acquired 47,000-acre (190 km&sup2;) Rancho  Lomas de Santiago for $7,000. After the Mexican-American war the land of Rancho  Santiago de Santa Ana fell prey to tangled titles. In 1868, the ranch was  divided among four claimants as part of a lawsuit: Flint, Bixby and Irvine. The  ranches were devoted to sheep grazing. However, in 1870, tenant farming was  permitted.<br />
          <br />
          In 1878, James Irvine acquired his partners' interests for $150,000. His  110,000 acres (450 km&sup2;) stretched 23 miles (37 km) from the Pacific Ocean to  the Santa Ana River. James Irvine died in 1886. The ranch was inherited by his  son, James Irvine, Jr. who incorporated it into The Irvine Company. James, Jr.  shifted the ranch operations to field crops, olive and citrus crops. In 1888,  the Santa Fe Railroad extended its line to Fallbrook Junction (north of San  Diego) and named a station along the way after James Irvine. The town that  formed around this station was named Myford, after Irvine's son, because a post  office in Calaveras County already bore the family name. The town was later  renamed Irvine, however, in 1914.[1] By 1918, 60,000 acres (240 km&sup2;) of lima  beans were grown on the Irvine Ranch. Two Marine Corps facilities were built on  the ranch during World War II and sold to the government. James Irvine, Jr.  died in 1947 at the age of 80. His son, Myford, assumed the presidency of The  Irvine Company. He began opening small sections of the Irvine Ranch to urban  development. Myford died in 1959. The same year, the University of California  asked The Irvine Company for 1,000 acres (4 km&sup2;) for a new university campus.  The Irvine Company gave away the requested land and the State purchased an  additional 500 acres (2 km&sup2;).William Pereira, the University's consulting  architect, and The Irvine Company planners drew up master plans for a city of  50,000 people surrounding the new university. The area would include  industrial, residential and recreational areas, commercial centers and  greenbelts. The new community was to be named Irvine; the old agricultural town  of Irvine, where the railroad station and post office were located, was renamed  East Irvine. The villages of Turtle Rock, University Park, Culverdale, the Ranch  and Walnut were completed by 1970. On December 28, 1971, the residents of these  communities voted to incorporate a substantially larger city than the one  envisioned by the Pereira plan. By January 1999, Irvine had a population of  134,000 and a total area of 43 square miles (111 km&sup2;). <br />
          <a name="About_Orange_County_California" id="About_Orange_County_California"></a><strong>ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY WHERE THE MAJORITY OF OUR  CLIENTS ARE:</strong> <br />
          Orange County is a  county in Southern California, United States. Its county seat is Santa Ana.  According to the 2000 Census, its population was 2,846,289, making it the  second most populous county in the state of California, and the fifth most  populous in the United States. The state of California estimates its population  as of 2007 to be 3,098,121 people, dropping its rank to third, behind San Diego  County. Thirty-four incorporated cities are located in Orange County; the  newest is Aliso Viejo. <br />
          <br />
          Unlike many other large centers of population in the United States, Orange  County uses its county name as its source of identification whereas other  places in the country are identified by the large city that is closest to them.  This is because there is no defined center to Orange County like there is in  other areas which have one distinct large city. Five Orange County cities have  populations exceeding 170,000 while no cities in the county have populations  surpassing 360,000. Seven of these cities are among the 200 largest cities in  the United States.<br />
          <br />
          Orange County is also famous as a tourist destination, as the county is home to  such attractions as Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, as well as sandy beaches  for swimming and surfing, yacht harbors for sailing and pleasure boating, and  extensive area devoted to parks and open space for golf, tennis, hiking,  kayaking, cycling, skateboarding, and other outdoor recreation. It is at the  center of Southern California's Tech Coast, with Irvine being the primary  business hub. <br />
          <br />
          The average price of a home in Orange County is $541,000. Orange County is the  home of a vast number of major industries and service organizations. As an  integral part of the second largest market in America, this highly diversified  region has become a Mecca for talented individuals in virtually every field  imaginable. Indeed the colorful pageant of human history continues to unfold  here; for perhaps in no other place on earth is there an environment more  conducive to innovative thinking, creativity and growth than this exciting, sun  bathed valley stretching between the mountains and the sea in Orange County.<br />
          <br />
          Orange County was Created March 11 1889, from part of Los Angeles County, and,  according to tradition, so named because of the flourishing orange culture.  Orange, however, was and is a commonplace name in the United States, used  originally in honor of the Prince of Orange, son-in-law of King George II of England. </p>

    By Kevin  McDonald <br />
    Most of us would not take our car to  just any auto mechanic. We want one who is trustworthy and will do the job  right -- the first time. Though there are honest mechanics, sometimes finding  one is harder than catching a fish without a hook. <br />
    Modern automobiles are so  complicated that when ordinary Joes and Janes bring their cars in for service  or repairs, they have trouble knowing if a mechanic is being truthful or taking  them for a ride. Bankrate.com spoke to auto mechanics with more than 20 years  of experience to learn what you should be aware of before handing your keys  over to a guy with a wrench in his pocket. The simple inspection<br />
    The cleanliness of the shop is an indication of the quality of work you can  expect. Because mechanics deal with oil and crud all day doesn't mean the shop  should look like a pigsty. Today, cars and trucks are much more computerized than  their predecessors. So you may want to see if the shop has the latest equipment  to properly diagnose and service your car. But that's not all. <br />
  &quot;The new technology is a help,  but if you're not trained it can cause you to misdiagnose,&quot; says our  expert, who spoke to us on condition that he remain anonymous. <br />
    Be  wary of advertisements<br />
    Do you remember the old saying, &quot;If it's too good to be true, it usually  is&quot;? The newspaper classifieds and mass-mail coupons are commonly stacked  with places offering specials to fix brakes, transmissions or any other part.  However, don't let your guard down so quickly. The special may not be work your  car needs. What's more, the mechanic may be so focused on giving you what the  ad specifically says that he may not check other vital components. <br />
    Read  the owner's manual<br />
    Yes, you should read that dust-covered book that's stashed at the bottom of  your glove compartment. It explains when to replace most engine parts. Many  auto shops and dealers try to sell customers services they may not need. If you  don't know when those parts need inspection or replacement, you'll take the  bait. Deal  with a qualified mechanic<br />
    Read the certificates hanging on the wall, and if there aren't any, you should  worry. Look for the Automotive Service Excellence Blue Seal, which indicates  technicians' competence in areas such as brake work, engine repair and  alignment. A shop gets the ASE designation when 75 percent of their technicians  are certified in one or more areas of repair work. Having the seal doesn't  guarantee that a mechanic is honest, but at least he knows what he's doing. <br />
  &quot;I would like to see consumers  more aware of the car they're driving,&quot; our auto expert says.  &quot;Educating yourself is very important.&quot;Women beware<br />
    Another source who was a mechanic for 24 years adds a special warning to female  customers.&quot;Mechanics take advantage of women -- that's standard,&quot; our  source says. &quot;That's because women are more inclined to believe  you.&quot;Women are especially vulnerable to being sold new parts they don't  need replaced. Our second insider says this is the most common questionable  practice he saw mechanics pull on customers, both women and men.&quot;Sometimes  a shop is having a promotion to sell or move car parts,&quot; our source  explains. &quot;They'll sell you stuff you don't really need. I've seen guys  sell tires that way.&quot;They use fear, raising safety issues -- especially  with female customers.&quot;Our source says it's rare to see a customer charged  for a part that isn't replaced. However, it is common to be sold parts you don't  really need.Most  or least<br />
    The source says that when a car needs a repair, the customer wants the least  amount of work done to fix it, while a mechanic wants to do the maximum. In  this case, the mechanic isn't necessarily trying to rip off the customer. He  just doesn't want something related to the problem to break a week later and  then he has to fix it for free! &quot;It's a genuine disagreement,&quot; the  source says. &quot;One viewpoint is: 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' The  other is 'Sometimes doing the most expensive thing is, in the long run, the  cheapest thing.'&quot;Mechanics usually win that argument.&quot;There's a gap  in knowledge,&quot; the source says. &quot;The mechanic knows what's going on  and the customer usually doesn't. Mechanics have an advantage, and they use it  to take advantage of people.&quot;Keep in mind that mechanics don't know  everything; sometimes they'll replace the wrong part thinking it will fix the  problem. When it doesn't, the mechanic has to find the part that's really  broken. And guess who pays for the extra parts and time?&quot;In that case, a  mechanic will tell a customer, &quot;Look, when I was down there, I saw that  the so-and-so was in terrible shape, and it needed to be fixed, too,&quot; the  source says.Watch  the dealer<br />
    All cars are not repaired equally, at least at dealerships. When a car is under  warranty, the manufacturer sets the fee for the repair, our source explains.  This means that mechanics make less money for those jobs than they do for  non-warranty jobs. So the car ends up being repaired by the least-experienced  mechanic. &quot;Newer mechanics get caught with all the grunt work,&quot; the  source says.This is why, when you have something on your car fixed under  warranty, it might take a few trips to the dealer to get the job done right.Last bit of advice<br />
    Use common sense -- and your gut feeling -- when your car needs repair.  &quot;Judge for yourself whether the mechanic is telling the truth,&quot; the  source says. &quot;If in fact you don't believe him and your car can limp home,  limp home.&quot;However, if you break down somewhere, don't expect mechanics to  give you a break. &quot;Basically, you're at their mercy,&quot; our source  says. </span></p>

  <li class="style68">
    <p>GLOSSARY OF AUTO  REPAIR SHOP TERMS AND DEFINITIONS </p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="style70"><strong>ABS (Antilock Brake System) </strong><br />
    This is a safety arrangement that enables wheels to brake rapidly without       locking and therefore causing a skid and loss of control. Computerized       sensors monitor wheel speeds; and during sudden decelerations, will alter       brake pressure rapidly by means of an electro-hydraulic system so that the       vehicle can still be steered (to avoid obstacles) while braking. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Adaptive Cruise Control</strong><br />
    An advanced computer system for speed organizing, which keeps a certain       distance between one car and the car ahead of it on the road. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Adaptive Suspension</strong><br />
    This is where the suspension system can be made more or less firm by a       computer as the car travels along changeable road conditions. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Air Bags</strong><br />
    Properly known as a &lsquo;Supplemental Inflatable Restraint System&rsquo; (which is       quite a mouthful - so no wonder everyone refers to it as an air bag);       these are safety devices which inflate in an instant in the unfortunate       event of a collision, to provide a cushioning effect which lessens the       shock of impact. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style70">Air bags  operate automatically when controlling sensors give the alert, though the  presence of these in a car should not give people a false sense of security,  which might make them not bother to wear seatbelts. The use of seat and  shoulder belts will maximize the effectiveness of air bags. </p>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Air Injection</strong><br />
    This is an environmentally friendly measure which sends boosts of air into       the exhaust of the engine, for purposes of burning off any fuel which       escaped initial combustion, to make emissions `cleaner.&rsquo; </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Alloy Wheels</strong><br />
    This is a term which is an example of how strange a language can sometimes       be. It is used in everyday speach to denote any wheels that are made from       a combination of metals (an alloy) rather than traditional steel, as most       wheels are. However, steel is actually a combination of carbon and iron -       and therefore is itself an alloy! </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>All Wheel Drive (AWD) </strong><br />
    This is where all the wheels are utilized as active drive wheels for       greater control in challenging road conditions. It works by dividing up       the engine torque between the front and rear wheels in varying amounts       depending on the needs. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style70">AWD is designed  as an on-road control system and is therefore <em>not</em> the same as Four Wheel  Drive (4WD or 4x4). (See also <em>Torque</em>). </p>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Alternator</strong><br />
    This is a generator powered by the engine that provides the electricity to       power the car&rsquo;s electrical components as well as for charging the battery. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Axles</strong><br />
    Each axle (front and rear) holds the wheels in place and allows them to       revolve. The word is derived from `axl&rsquo; which is an old English word       meaning `shoulder.&rsquo; </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Catalytic Converter</strong><br />
    The proper name for what is often known as a <em>catalyst</em> or sometimes       just a <em>cat</em>. This is a device fitted to the exhaust and used for       making the exhaust gases less harmful to the environment. It accomplishes       this task by a process of chemical reactions that change the properties of       the emissions but not the converter itself - hence it is a catalyst. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Chassis</strong><br />
    This is the basic structure (frame) of an automobile. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Clutchless Manual</strong><br />
    A hybrid gearing mechanism where, although it is an automatic       transmission, the driver can himself / herself change gears manually in       sequence. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Coefficient of Drag (CD) </strong><br />
    This is a number that is a measure of an automobile&rsquo;s resistance to the       air it passes through, with lower numbers meaning the car has greater       aerodynamic properties. It is one factor that influences the smoothness of       ride and better fuel economy. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Coolant</strong><br />
    Coolant is a water and anti-freeze mixture that takes heat away from the       engine (to stop it overheating) and transports it to the air in the       radiator. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Composite Headlamps</strong><br />
    These are improved headlamps for enhanced illumination as compared to the       standard sealed beam units. They often, but not always, contain       replaceable halogen bulbs with separate acrylic lenses. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Curb Weight</strong><br />
    This means the weight of any vehicle with a full tank of gas but without       any load or passengers. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Differential</strong><br />
    The differential is the gear assembly that connects to the drive shaft, or       both sides of an axle. It transmits drive power to the wheel axles, and       allows opposite wheels to turn at different speeds when the automobile       turns a corner. (See also<em> Drive Shaft, Drivetrain, and Transaxle</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Disc Brakes</strong><br />
    A mechanism for braking where, what are called brake pads, are attached to       a hydraulic caliper, which stands astride a disc attached to the wheel.       The caliper can close in a vise-like grip to slow the disc and therefore       the wheel. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style70">Experts say  that disc brakes work better in wet driving conditions than drum brakes. (See <em>Drum  Brakes</em>). </p>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Displacement</strong><br />
    The displacement of an engine, usually given in either cubic inches or       liters, is a measure of the volume of its cylinders. How much air they can       draw in is a theoretical gauge to both size and power output. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Distributor</strong><br />
    Part of the ignition, which sends pulses of electricity to the spark       plugs. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Drag Coefficient (dc) </strong><br />
    See <em>Coefficient Of Drag (CD)</em>. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Drive Shaft</strong><br />
    The shaft that sends power through to the differential from the       transmission in a standard rear wheel drive system. (See <em>Differential,       RWD, and Transaxle</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Drivetrain</strong><br />
    Sometimes known as the <em>powertrain</em>, this is the collective name for       all the components that are directly involved in the power production that       is needed to get and keep the automobile moving. This includes the engine       (obviously) as well as the likes of the clutch, transmission (or gearbox)       driveshafts, differential, and wheel axles. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Drum Brakes</strong><br />
    A braking system where a metal drum is attached to the wheel, and the       rotation of this, and so the wheel, is slowed and halted by curved devices       called brake shoes being pressed hard against the brake lining which       causes friction on the inside of the drum. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Dynamo</strong><br />
    See <em>Alternator</em>. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Electrochromatic Mirror</strong><br />
    This is a rearview mirror that contains light sensitive properties, so       that it can darken to avoid glare from following vehicles&rsquo; headlamps at       night. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) </strong><br />
    There are different types of fuel injection systems, but all have replaced       the carburetor for introducing fuel into the engine with much more precise       control and timing. This has many advantages in fuel economy terms, as       well as providing better engine performance and reliability, with lower       exhaust emissions. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Electronic Stability System</strong><br />
    These computerized systems aid safer driving by combating the effects of       both understeer and oversteer. (See <em>Oversteer and Understeer</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>FWD (Front Wheel Drive) </strong><br />
    In this arrangement, the motive force from the engine is applied the front       wheels only rather that the rear wheels, as is the norm. FWD cars have       benefits which include; more space at the back for passengers or load; and       better grip in wet weather (because the front wheels are pressed down by       the heavier weight of the engine). But FWD cars can also be inclined to       understeer when driven with temper or haste. (See <em>Understeer</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Galvanized Steel</strong><br />
    This is steel that has been given a coating of zinc to prevent rusting. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Gear Ratio</strong><br />
    This how many turns is required from a smaller pinion gear to power a       driven gear through one full revolution. (See <em>Pinion</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Global Positioning System / Satellites (GPS) </strong><br />
    Originally developed for the military, this is a set of satellites that       constantly broadcast signals down to earth which when received, are used       to work out the exact geographical location of the receiver. This has       recently appeared as an option for automobiles, and can also be referred       to by the abbreviation <strong>satnav</strong> (satellite navigation) in many       countries. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Head Rest / Restraint</strong><br />
    A small padded and adjustable cushion which when present on a car seat can       protect against whiplash injuries to the neck. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Horsepower (hp) </strong><br />
    The standard unit for measuring engine power: 1 hp is the power required       to lift 550 pounds of weight one foot high in a second. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Independent Suspension</strong><br />
    This is where each wheel on an axle can move up and down at a different       rate to the other, rather than always moving together. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Metallic Paint</strong><br />
    A paint which contains tiny dots of metal in its makeup to give it extra       quality. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Normally Aspirated</strong><br />
    An engine that is not fitted with either a turbo or supercharger. (See <em>Supercharger       and Turbocharger</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Overdrive</strong><br />
    This is the highest gear in a transmission that is used for reasons of       fuel economy when at cruising speed (and not to make the car go faster, as       is quite widely believed). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Oversteer</strong><br />
    The opposite of understeer, this is when the vehicle turns much more than       was desired by the driver. It is a condition more commonly found when       cornering forcefully in RWD than FWD vehicles because sudden power to the       rear wheels can cause them to slide sideways. (See also <em>Electronic       Stability System, FWD, RWD, and Understeer</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Pearl Paint</strong><br />
    This car paint has minuscule flecks of mica in it to reflect light in a       lustrous way that is particularly attractive to the eye. Mica is a group       of mineral silicates, which form in hexagonally shaped plates of crystal. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Pinion</strong><br />
    This is the name of a small-toothed driving gear which fits into a larger       driven gear wheel called a rack or ring; as in rack and pinion steering,       for the most well known example. (See <em>Gear Ratio</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Powertrain</strong><br />
    See <em>Drivetrain</em>. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Push</strong><br />
    See <em>Understeer</em>. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>RWD (Rear Wheel Drive) </strong><br />
    This is where all the drive power needed for the car goes through the       transmission to the rear axle, and so only rear wheels are powered, with       the front wheels just being used for steering alone. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>SatNav</strong><br />
    See <em>Global Positioning System / Satellites (GPS)</em>. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Spoilers </strong><br />
    These are devices which improve tire traction (grip) by increasing what is       known as downforce on a car. They improve braking, stability and cornering       at speed by breaking up the clean aerodynamic lines of the bodywork, and       using the force created as a vehicle passes through the air to press the       car down onto the road. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Standard</strong><br />
    This refers to equipment that is included in the base list price of an       automobile. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Supercharger</strong><br />
    This is a mechanism that pressurizes air to increase engine power, but       unlike a turbocharger it is driven by a belt or gearing and thus though       stronger, is more complex. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Suspension</strong><br />
    This is the system of springs and shock absorbers etc. which suspend the       automobile above the wheels, and prevent the occupants from bouncing       around in their seats (unless they want to, but that&rsquo;s another story       entirely). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Tachometer</strong><br />
    This sits on the instrument panel and shows the speed that the crankshaft       is rotating at in RPM (revolutions per minute) to give a measure of how       hard the engine is working. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Torque</strong><br />
    This is a rotating or twisting force. Torque is what it&rsquo;s all about; the       engine power developed from the cylinders, rods and pistons is sent       through to the crankshaft for converting into a rotating motion (torque)       which then is used through the transmission (or gearbox) to get the wheels       moving. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Traction Control</strong><br />
    Having this system fitted helps to reduce wheel spin during acceleration,       so allowing for improved driver control. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Transaxle</strong><br />
    This mechanism combines the duties of a differential and a transmission,       and is commonly used in front wheel drive (FWD) automobiles. Having a       transaxle means that there is no need for the drive shafts which are used       to connect the differential to the transmission in rear wheel drive (RWD)       cars. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Transmission </strong><br />
    This is the gearing, and is used for controlling the behavior of the       engine. <strong>Turbocharger (Turbo) </strong><br />
    This piece of equipment is driven by flowing exhaust gases, and works to       increase the power produced by the engine by allowing it to burn up more       fuel than it ordinarily could. The turbocharger achieves this feat by       pressurizing the air taken in by the engine - more air means more       combustion, of more fuel. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Understeer</strong><br />
    The opposite of oversteer, this is when a vehicle turns much less than the       driver desired it to. This is a state of affairs that is more commonly       encountered when cornering aggressively in FWD than RWD vehicles because       sudden power to the front wheels can cause them to lose traction and push       onwards without turning well. (See also <em>Electronic Stability System,       FWD, Oversteer, and RWD</em>). </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Unibody Construction</strong><br />
    This is where the automobile&rsquo;s bodywork does not have need of a separate       frame for the providing of support to the car&rsquo;s various mechanisms,       because the frame and body have been merged into one. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Weight Distribution</strong><br />
    A very important consideration for pickup trucks and the like, but also       cars as well, this is how the total weight will be carried by each axle       and tire. Components parts such as axles, springs, bearings, and tires       will have much less of a service life if they have to bear more than an       equal share of the load. The safety of the vehicle can also be compromised       with a poor weight distribution. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style70">
  <li><strong>Wheelbase</strong><br />
    This is the distance between the front and rear wheels, measured from the       center of each. </li>
  <li><strong>VIN</strong><br />
    Acronym for Vehicle Identification Number. This is a unique number that       identifies your vehicle. Although its primary purpose is to identify your       vehicle, it often contains important information concerning the equipment       and options that were installed on your vehicle at the factory. This       information allows the Repair Center to order the correct parts for your       vehicle. Any professional estimate or Repair Order will have this number       on it. </li>

<p class="style70"><strong>Automobile</strong> <br />
  An automobile or motor car is a  wheeled motor vehicle for transporting passengers, which also carries its own  engine or motor. Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are  designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to  typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport  of people rather than goods. However, the term is far from precise because  there are many types of vehicles that do similar tasks. <br />
  Automobile comes via the French  language, from the Greek language by combining auto [self] with mobilis  [moving]; meaning a vehicle that moves itself, rather than being pulled or  pushed by a separate animal or another vehicle. The alternative name car is  believed to originate from the Latin word carrus or carrum [wheeled vehicle],  or the Middle English word carre [cart] (from Old North French), and karros; a  Gallic wagon. <br />
  As of 2002, there were 590 million  passenger cars worldwide (roughly one car per eleven people). </p>

<p class="style68">History </p>
<p class="style70">Although Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is often credited with building the first self-propelled mechanical vehicle or automobile in about 1769 by adapting an existing horse-drawn vehicle, this claim is disputed by some, who doubt Cugnot's three-wheeler ever ran or was stable. Others claim Ferdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built the first steam-powered vehicle around 1672 which was of small scale and designed as a toy for the Chinese Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger, but quite possibly, was the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile'). What is not in doubt is that Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive in 1801, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle although it was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and would have been of little practical use. In Russia, in the 1780s, Ivan Kulibin developed a human-pedalled, three-wheeled carriage with modern features such as a flywheel, brake, gear box, and bearings; however, it was not developed further. Fran&ccedil;ois Isaac de Rivaz, a Swiss inventor, designed the first internal combustion engine, in 1806, which was fueled by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen and used it to develop the world's first vehicle, albeit rudimentary, to be powered by such an engine. The design was not very successful, as was the case with others such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by clumsy internal combustion engines. In November 1881 French inventor Gustave Trouv&eacute; demonstrated a working three-wheeled automobile that was powered by electricity. This was at the International Exhibition of Electricity in Paris. Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on the problem at about the same time, Karl Benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern automobile. An automobile powered by his own four-stroke cycle gasoline engine was built in Mannheim, Germany by Karl Benz in 1885 and granted a patent in January of the following year under the auspices of his major company, Benz &amp; Cie., which was founded in 1883. It was an integral design, without the adaptation of other existing components and including several new technological elements to create a new concept. This is what made it worthy of a patent. He began to sell his production vehicles in 1888. In 1879 Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagon was built in 1885 and he was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on January 29, 1886. Benz began promotion of the vehicle on July 3, 1886 and approximately 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz automobile to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early automobiles, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called a boxermotor in German. During the last years of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and because of its size, Benz &amp; Cie., became a joint-stock company. Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (Daimler Motor Company, DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890 and under the brand name, Daimler, sold their first automobile in 1892, which was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, that they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after falling out with their backers. Benz and the Maybach and Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together because by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes, that was placed in a specially-ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG automobile was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers. Karl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz &amp; Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the First World War, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their automobile models jointly&mdash;although keeping their respective brands. On June 28, 1926, Benz &amp; Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its automobiles Mercedes Benz as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35hp, along with the Benz name. Karl Benz remained a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz until his death in 1929 and at times, his two sons participated in the management of the company as well. In 1890, Emile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines and so laid the foundation of the automobile industry in France. The first design for an American automobile with a gasoline internal combustion engine was drawn in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York, who applied for a patent for an automobile in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built and proved to work (a requirement for a patent). After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on November 5, 1895, Selden was granted a United States patent (U.S. Patent 549,160 ) for a two-stroke automobile engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of automobiles in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911. In Britain there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860. Santler from Malvern is recognized by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first petrol-powered car in the country in 1894 followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895 but these were both one-offs. The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Motor Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896 after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its first automobiles in 1897 and they bore the name Daimler. In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a &quot;New Rational Combustion Engine&quot;. In 1897 he built the first Diesel Engine.[8] Steam-, electric-, and gasoline-powered vehicles competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success. Production The large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable automobiles was debuted by Ransom Olds at his Oldsmobile factory in 1902. This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1914. As a result, Ford's cars came off the line in fifteen minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing production by seven to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower. It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark, &quot;any color as long as it's black&quot;. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay. Ford's complex safety procedures&mdash;especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about&mdash;dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called &quot;Fordism,&quot; and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods. In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared. Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910-1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes. Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced automobile design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, so buyers could &quot;move up&quot; as their fortunes improved. Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate drivetrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left. In Europe much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practise of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra had gone under. Citroen did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete. Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at Russelsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market. Fuel and propulsion technologies Most automobiles in use today are propelled by gasoline (also known as petrol) or diesel internal combustion engines, which are known to cause air pollution and are also blamed for contributing to climate change and global warming. Increasing costs of oil-based fuels, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for automobiles. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles, and electric and hydrogen vehicles which do not release pollution into the air. Petroleum fuels Diesel Diesel-engined cars have long been popular in Europe with the first models being introduced in the 1930s by Mercedes Benz and Citroen. The main benefit of diesel engines is a 50% fuel burn efficiency compared with 27% in the best gasoline engines. A down-side of the diesel is the presence in the exhaust gases of fine soot particulates and manufacturers are now starting to fit filters to remove these. Many diesel-powered cars can also run with little or no modifications on 100% biodiesel. Gasoline Gasoline engines have the advantage over diesel in being lighter and able to work at higher rotational speeds and they are the usual choice for fitting in high-performance sports cars. Continuous development of gasoline engines for over a hundred years has produced improvements in efficiency and reduced pollution. The carburetor was used on nearly all road car engines until the 1980s but it was long realised better control of the fuel/air mixture could be achieved with fuel injection. Indirect fuel injection was first used in aircraft engines from 1909, in racing car engines from the 1930s, and road cars from the late 1950s. Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) is now starting to appear in production vehicles such as the 2007 (Mark II) BMW Mini. Exhaust gases are also cleaned up by fitting a catalytic converter into the exhaust system. Clean air legislation in many of the car industries most important markets has made both catalysts and fuel injection virtually universal fittings. Most modern gasoline engines also are capable of running with up to 15% ethanol mixed into the gasoline - older vehicles may have seals and hoses that can be harmed by ethanol. With a small amount of redesign, gasoline-powered vehicles can run on ethanol concentrations as high as 85%. 100% ethanol is used in some parts of the world (such as Brazil), but vehicles must be started on pure gasoline and switched over to ethanol once the engine is running. Most gasoline engined cars can also run on LPG with the addition of an LPG tank for fuel storage and carburetion modifications to add an LPG mixer. LPG produces fewer toxic emissions and is a popular fuel for fork lift trucks that have to operate inside buildings. Biofuels Ethanol, other alcohol fuels (biobutanol) and biogasoline have widespread use an automotive fuel. Most alcohols have less energy per liter than gasoline and are usually blended with gasoline. Alcohols are used for a variety of reasons - to increase octane, to improve emissions, and as an alternative to petroleum based fuel, since they can be made from agricultural crops. Brazil's ethanol program provides about 20% of the nation's automotive fuel needs, as a result of the mandatory use of E25 blend of gasoline throughout the country, 3 million cars that operate on pure ethanol, and 6 million dual or flexible-fuel vehicles sold since 2003. that run on any mix of ethanol and gasoline. The commercial success of &quot;flex&quot; vehicles, as they are popularly known, have allowed sugarcane based ethanol fuel to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline market by April 2008.  Electric The first electric cars were built around 1832, well before internal combustion powered cars appeared. For a period of time electrics were considered superior due to the silent nature of electric motors compared to the very loud noise of the gasoline engine. This advantage was removed with Hiram Percy Maxim's invention of the muffler in 1897. Thereafter internal combustion powered cars had two critical advantages: 1) long range and 2) high specific energy (far lower weight of petrol fuel versus weight of batteries). The building of battery electric vehicles that could rival internal combustion models had to wait for the introduction of modern semiconductor controls and improved batteries. Because they can deliver a high torque at low revolutions electric cars do not require such a complex drive train and transmission as internal combustion powered cars. Some post-2000 electric car designs such as the Venturi F&eacute;tish are able to accelerate from 0-60 mph (96 km/h) in 4.0 seconds with a top speed around 130 mph (210 km/h). Others have a range of 250 miles (400 km) on the EPA highway cycle requiring 3-1/2 hours to completely charge. Equivalent fuel efficiency to internal combustion is not well defined but some press reports give it at around 135 miles per US gallon (57 km/l/162 mpg-imp).  Steam Steam power, usually using an oil- or gas-heated boiler, was also in use until the 1930s but had the major disadvantage of being unable to power the car until boiler pressure was available (although the newer models could achieve this in well under a minute). It has the advantage of being able to produce very low emissions as the combustion process can be carefully controlled. Its disadvantages include poor heat efficiency and extensive requirements for electric auxiliaries. Air A compressed air car is an alternative fuel car that uses a motor powered by compressed air. The car can be powered solely by air, or by air combined (as in a hybrid electric vehicle) with gasoline/diesel/ethanol or electric plant and regenerative braking. Instead of mixing fuel with air and burning it to drive pistons with hot expanding gases; compressed air cars use the expansion of compressed air to drive their pistons. Several prototypes are available already and scheduled for worldwide sale by the end of 2008. Companies releasing this type of car include Tata Motors and Motor Development International (MDI). Gas turbine In the 1950s there was a brief interest in using gas turbine engines and several makers including Rover and Chrysler produced prototypes. In spite of the power units being very compact, high fuel consumption, severe delay in throttle response, and lack of engine braking meant no cars reached production. Rotary (Wankel) engines Rotary Wankel engines were introduced into road cars by NSU with the Ro 80 and later were seen in the Citro&euml;n GS Birotor and several Mazda models. In spite of their impressive smoothness, poor reliability and fuel economy led to them largely disappearing. Mazda, beginning with the R100 then RX-2, has continued research on these engines, overcoming most of the earlier problems with the RX-7 and RX-8. Rocket and jet cars A rocket car holds the record in drag racing. However, the fastest of those cars are used to set the Land Speed Record, and are propelled by propulsive jets emitted from rocket, turbojet, or more recently and most successfully turbofan engines. The ThrustSSC car using two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans with reheat was able to exceed the speed of sound at ground level in 1997. Safety ________________________________________ There are three main statistics to which automobile safety can be compared: Deaths per  billion journeys Bus: 4.3 Rail: 20 Van: 20 Car: 40 Foot: 40 Water: 90 Air: 117 Bicycle: 170 Motorcycle: 1640 Deaths per  billion hours Bus: 11.1 Rail: 30 Air: 30.8 Water: 50 Van: 60 Car: 130 Foot: 220 Bicycle: 550 Motorcycle: 4840 Deaths per billion kilometres Air: 0.05 Bus: 0.4 Rail: 0.6 Van: 1.2 Water: 2.6 Car: 3.1 Bicycle: 44.6 Foot: 54.2 Motorcycle: 108.9 While road traffic injuries represent the leading cause in worldwide injury-related deaths, their popularity undermines this statistic. Mary Ward became one of the first documented automobile fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland and Henry Bliss one of the United State's first pedestrian automobile casualties in 1899 in New York. There are now standard tests for safety in new automobiles, like the EuroNCAP and the US NCAP tests, as well as insurance-backed IIHS tests. </p>
<p><span class="style70"><strong>Economics  and impacts</strong> <br />
      <strong>Cost  and benefits of usage</strong> <br />
  The costs of automobile usage, which  may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs, maintenance, fuel,  depreciation, parking fees, tire replacement, taxes and insurance, are weighed  against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits - perceived  and real - of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation,  mobility, independence and convenience. <br />
  <strong>Cost  and benefits to society</strong> <br />
  Similarly the costs to society of  encompassing automobile use, which may include those of: maintaining roads,  land use, pollution, public health, health care, and of disposing of the  vehicle at the end of its life, can be balanced against the value of the  benefits to society that automobile use generates. The societal benefits may  include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of automobile production  and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from  leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax  opportunities. The ability for humans to move flexibly from place to place has  far reaching implications for the nature of societies. <br />
  <strong>Impacts  on society and environment</strong> <br />
  Transportation is a major  contributor to air pollution in most industrialised nations. According to the  American Surface Transportation Policy Project nearly half of all Americans are  breathing unhealthy air. Their study showed air quality in dozens of  metropolitan areas has got worse over the last decade. In the United States the  average passenger car emits 11,450 lbs (5 tonnes) of carbon dioxide, along with  smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen. Residents of  low-density, residential-only sprawling communities are also more likely to die  in car collisions, which kill 1.2 million people worldwide each year, and  injure about forty times this number. Sprawl is more broadly a factor in  inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety  of diseases. <br />
  <strong>Improving  the positive and reducing the negative impacts</strong> <br />
  Fuel taxes may act as an incentive  for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g.  hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes may  provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more  fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. On average, today's automobiles are about  75 percent recyclable, and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and  pollution. In the United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency  standards have been debated regularly, passenger car standards have not risen  above the 27.5 miles per US gallon (11.7 km/l/33.0 mpg imp) standard set in  1985. Light truck standards have changed more frequently, and were set at 22.2  miles per US gallon (9.4 km/l/26.7 mpg imp) in 2007. Alternative fuel vehicles  are another option that is less polluting than conventional petroleum powered  vehicles. <br />
  <strong>Future  car technologies</strong> <br />
  Automobile propulsion technology  under development include gasoline/electric and plug-in hybrids, battery  electric vehicles, hydrogen cars, biofuels, and various alternative fuels. <br />
  Research into future alternative  forms of power include the development of fuel cells, Homogeneous Charge  Compression Ignition (HCCI), stirling engines, and even using the stored energy  of compressed air or liquid nitrogen. <br />
  New materials which may replace  steel car bodies include duraluminum, fiberglass, carbon fiber, and carbon  nanotubes. <br />
  Telematics technology is allowing  more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through such  schemes as City Car Club in the UK, Mobility in mainland Europe, and Zipcar in  the US. <br />
  <strong>Alternatives  to the automobile</strong> <br />
  Established alternatives for some  aspects of automobile use include public transit (buses, trolleybuses, trains,  subways, monorails, tramways), cycling, walking, rollerblading, skateboarding,  horseback riding and using a velomobile. Car-share arrangements and carpooling  are also increasingly popular&ndash;the U.S. market leader in car-sharing has  experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006  and 2007, offering a service that enables urban residents to &quot;share&quot;  a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighborhoods. Bike-share  systems have been tried in some European cities, including Copenhagen and  Amsterdam. Similar programs have been experimented with in a number of U.S. Cities.  Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could  serve as an alternative to automobiles if they prove to be socially accepted. <br />
  <strong>Auto mechanic</strong> <br />
  An <strong>auto mechanic</strong> (or <strong>car  mechanic</strong> in British English and <strong>motor mechanic</strong> in Australian English) is a mechanic who specializes in  automobile maintenance, repair, and sometimes modification. A mechanic may be  knowledgeable in working on all parts of a variety of car makes or may  specialize either in a specific area or in a specific make of car. In repairing  cars, their main role is to diagnose the problem accurately and quickly. They  often have to quote prices for their customers before commencing work or after  partial disassembly for inspection. The mechanic uses both electronic means of  gathering data as well as their senses. Their job may involve the repair of a  specific part or the replacement of one or more parts as assemblies. <br />
  Basic vehicle maintenance is a  fundamental part of a mechanic's work in some countries, while in others they  are only consulted when a vehicle is already showing signs of malfunction.  Preventative maintenance is also a fundamental part of a mechanic's job, but  this is not possible in the case of vehicles that are not regularly maintained  by a mechanic. One misunderstood aspect of preventative maintenance is <em>scheduled replacement</em> of various parts, which occurs before failure to avoid far  more expensive damage. Because this means that parts are replaced before any  problem is observed, many vehicle owners will not understand why the expense is  necessary. <br />
  With the rapid advancement in  technology, the mechanic's job has evolved from purely mechanical, to include  electronic technology. Because vehicles today possess complex computer and  electronic systems, mechanics need to have a broader base of knowledge than in  the past. Lately, the term &quot;auto mechanic&quot; is being used less and  less frequently and is being replaced by the euphemistic title &ldquo;automotive  service technician&rdquo;. Fading quickly is the day of the 'shade tree mechanic',  who needed little knowledge of today's computerized systems. <br />
  Due to the increasingly labyrinthine  nature of the technology that is now incorporated into automobiles, most  automobile dealerships now provide sophisticated diagnostic computers to each  technician, without which they would be unable to diagnose or repair a vehicle. <br />
  <strong>Automotive industry</strong> <br />
  The automotive industry is the  industry involved in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and sale  of motor vehicles. In 2007, more than 73 million motor vehicles, including cars  and commercial vehicles were produced worldwide. <br />
  In 2007, a total of 71.9 million new  automobiles were sold worldwide: 22.9 million in Europe, 21.4 million in  Asia-Pacific, 19.4 million in USA and Canada, 4.4 million in Latin America, 2.4  million in the Middle East and 1.4 million in Africa. The markets in North  America and Japan were stagnant, while those in South America and Asia grew  strongly. Of the major markets, Russia, Brazil and China saw the most rapid  growth. <br />
  In 2008, with rapidly rising oil  prices, industries such as the automotive industry, are experiencing a  combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in  consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external  competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their  private vehicle usage. </span></p>

<p class="style70"><span class="style71">List of automobiles sales by model</span> <br />
  This is a list of automobiles sales  by model since the introduction of the Benz Patent Motorwagen in 1886. Wherever  possible, references to verify the claims have been included, however even  figures given by manufacturers may have a degree of inaccuracy or hyperbole.  Also note that a single vehicle can be sold concurrently under several  nameplates in different markets, as with for example the Nissan Sunny; in such  circumstances manufacturers often provide only cumulative sales figures for all  models. As a result, there is no definitive standard for measuring sales. <br />
  Vehicles listed in italics are those  who achieved their figures through sales of a single generation without any  major redesign. The most common distinction is to refer to these specifically  as the &quot;bestselling vehicles&quot;, as opposed to &quot;bestselling  nameplates&quot;, where sales have been achieved through perpetuation of the  brand name across several unrelated generations of automobiles. </p>
<span class="style70">The two vehicles most frequently cited as the  bestselling automobiles in the world are the Toyota Corolla and the Volkswagen  Beetle.</span>
