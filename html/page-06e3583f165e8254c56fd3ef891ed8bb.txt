		<h2>Information About Hybrids</h2>

		<h3>Is it worth it to buy a hybrid?</h3>

		<p>This totally depends on what you are looking for. Right now,
		you will still probably spend more for a hybrid than you will
		save in gas over the long haul, compared to a conventional
		propulsion system. But there are other reasons to buy a hybrid.
		If you subscribe to the theory of global warming, there is no
		question that hybrids emit less CO<sub>2</sub> than a
		conventional power plant. And even you are not convinced that
		man has a major influence on our climate, no one can argue that
		burning less oil and emitting less pollution is a good thing.

		<h3>How long will my hybrid high voltage battery last?</h3>

		<p>It would seem they last a pretty long time. Toyota's warranty
		on the batteries is 10 years 100,000 miles. Some states, like
		California, require an extension of that warranty for even
		longer. We have heard Toyota claims that since the Prius model
		year 2000, they have not replaced a HV battery due to wear and
		tear. The best answer to this question is: time will tell.

		<h3>How much does the replacement battery cost?</h3>

		<p>Hybrids have two batteries. The high voltage battery that
		powers the car is the expensive one. You should check with your
		manufacturer for the actual cost. The MSRP for the HV battery on
		our Toyota Camry Hybrid is about $3600.00. Many people claim
		that by the time your hybrid battery needs to be replaced, the
		batteries will be cheaper and better. We'll see.

		<h3>Do I have to plug in a hybrid?</h3>

		<p>As of now, you don't. There are companies that do plug-in
		conversions that enable the car to be driven further on
		electricity alone. Just remember plugging in your hybrid will
		raise your electricity bill, and in most cases something was
		burned and pollution was emitted to produce that power.

		<h3>How come my Prius doesn't really get 60 mpg in the
		city?</h3>

		<p>The Prius is capable of running on batteries alone up to 40
		mph. It can do this until the battery discharges too far. After
		that the I.C.E. (internal combustion engine) is running. Also,
		while it is possible to accelerate from a stop to 40 mph without
		the I.C.E. coming on, it requires a VERY light foot and you will
		likely have some upset people behind you.

		<p>When you are on battery alone you are getting infinite mpg
		but it drops way off when you accelerate normally. If there was
		some city, somewhere, where you could drive around at 40 mph or
		less and never or rarely have to stop at a light, I'm sure you
		could get 60 mpg. If you happen to live in such a city, let us
		know because we're going to move there.

		<p>Our guess is the EPA testing was done under optimal
		conditions as opposed to real world conditions. Most of our
		Prius owners are getting 45-48 mpg average. Civic Hybrids are
		running about 40-42 mpg, and Insights can top 50 mpg. Our Camry
		Hybrid gets a consistent 37-38 mpg and it has plenty of pep,
		seating five adults in reasonable comfort.

		<h3>What's wrong with the gas gauge on my Prius?</h3>

		<p>Chances are nothing is wrong with the gas gauge on your
		Prius. They are so notoriously inaccurate that some refer to the
		gas gauge as the "guess gauge."

		<p>The gauge inaccuracy is due to a very unique design inside
		the gas tank. Inside the metal tank is a rubber bladder that
		contains the fuel. The idea is that as the fuel level goes down,
		the bladder collapses, thereby limiting the amount of air the
		fuel is exposed to, and reducing evaporative emissions. The
		problem, it seems, is the amount of fuel the rubber bladder can
		hold is greatly affected by ambient temperature -- so you may
		find the accuracy of the gas gauge varies with the seasons.
		Nice.

		<p>The bottom line here is: don't let your Prius run out of gas!
		It can cause problems. If the gas gauge begins to flash, fill up
		as soon as possible. Better yet, fill it up when you get down to
		1/2 tank. You will be glad you did if some disaster strikes and
		you can't pump gas because the power is out.

		<h3>If I own a hybrid, can I drive in the HOV lane?</h3>

		<p>In California, many cars that had an EPA mileage rating over
		45 mpg and met certain emission standards were eligible for HOV
		lane stickers no matter what powered them. However, California
		is no longer issuing HOV stickers and this law is set to expire
		in 2011. Please be aware of this before you spend top dollar for
		a used hybrid that has HOV stickers. The stickers may become
		useless in a few years if new laws are not passed.

		<h3>Should I buy a hybrid with a "salvage" title to save a few
		bucks?</h3>

		<p>Be very careful here. When gas prices were spiking during the
		summer in 2008, we were inundated with folks wanting us to do
		pre-purchase inspections on used Priuses (or would it be
		Priusi?). The ones with HOV stickers that were not salvaged were
		selling for 4 to 6 thousand dollars more the brand new ones.
		Salvage Priuses with HOV stickers were selling for nearly the
		same price as new ones. We inspected over 10 salvaged Priuses in
		a month and only had a "buy" recommendation for one of them. If
		you're thinking of buying any salvage-title used car you should
		have it inspected by a trustworthy, un-biased shop that has your
		best interests in mind.

		<h3>How do I get the best mileage out of my hybrid?</h3>

		<p>All of our <a href="/fuel_saving_tips.cgi">suggestions for fuel savings for
		regular cars</a>
		still apply to hybrids, with some minor tweaking.

		<p>Hybrids get better mileage for one reason alone: regenerative
		braking recycles the energy that a conventional vehicle wastes
		when it is decelerating or braking. Any time your foot is off
		the gas pedal, you are recycling the normally wasted energy and
		storing it in the HV battery for later use. This does not mean
		our advice to "avoid using your brakes" should be ignored if you
		are driving hybrid. At a certain point, if you brake hard
		enough, the conventional brakes on your hybrid will apply and
		slow the car, wasting energy.

		<p>Try to keep your hybrid in "stealth mode," a term used by
		hybrid enthusiasts: any time the car is turned on and the engine
		is not running, you are in stealth mode. The onboard computer
		controls stealth mode completely but there are some things you
		can do to encourage it. Stealth mode can only occur below 40
		mph. Go for stealth mode when you can anticipate a substantial
		run at a constant speed below 40 without stopping.

		<p>To get there quickly, accelerate from a stop quickly to just
		above your desired speed, then lift your foot. If the HV battery
		is sufficiently charged, the engine should shut down. Now you
		can add just enough pedal to maintain your desired speed. You
		are now getting infinite mpg. Try to anticipate upcoming stops
		and coast down as long as possible before hitting the brakes.

		<p>Be aware that "stealth mode" only applies to the Toyota
		Hybrid System (THS), or generation 1 Prius, and the Hybrid
		Synergy Drive system (HSD). One of these systems is used on all
		Toyota, Lexus, Nissan, Ford Escape, and Mercury Mariner hybrids.
		It does not apply to Honda Hybrids, as they cannot run on
		electricity alone.

		<h3>What does the "B" position do on the transmission shift
		lever?</h3>

		<p>"B" stands for braking. If you are going down a long steep
		grade and are worried about using up your brakes, you can shift
		to "B." This will allow the compression of the engine to help
		slow the car. It is similar to down-shifting a conventional
		transmission.

		<p>The testing we've done indicates that using up or overheating
		your brakes is not a big concern because of the regenerative
		braking that occurs. We've gone down some very steep grades that
		would have smoked the brakes on a regular car without using the
		"B" range and have not heated up the hybrid's brakes at all.
		What we don't yet know is if you get better mileage using "B" or
		just using the brake pedal. We suspect that "B" uses more fuel
		because the engine is running at high rpm in "B."

		<h3>Hybrid Horrors</h3>
		<b>(or what not to do to your hybrid)</b>

		<p>We have a customer who drives a 2002 Prius. They brought the
		12v battery in without the car, saying it went dead and could we
		please charge and test it. We did, and the battery tested fine.
		We advised them to make an appointment so we could check out the
		electrical system to make sure everything was ok.

		<p>They put the battery back in the car and resumed using the
		car. It did not take long for the problems to begin again. What
		we didn't know was the master warning light (a triangle with an
		exclamation point inside it) and several other warning lights
		were also on.  The Prius arrived a few days later on a tow
		truck, out of gas and with the high voltage battery almost
		completely discharged. The gas gauge read about 1\2 full.

		<p>What the owner did not realize was that you can drive a Prius
		around with no gas and the engine not running! Sounds great
		until the HV battery runs out of juice. Just a little bit more
		driving with no gas, and this car would have been headed for an
		expensive trip to the dealer to get its high voltage battery
		recharged.

		<p>After adding gas and resetting all of the 7 computers on the
		Prius, everything was fine. The Prius has a notoriously
		inaccurate gas gauge but this was a little extreme. This car
		needed a new fuel tank, engine computer, and a flash reprogram
		to correct the problem.

		<p>The moral of the story is: don't ignore the warning lights on
		any car, especially a hybrid. If they are coming on, then there
		may be a problem that needs to be addressed to avoid getting
		stranded and incurring unnecessary costs.
