Land Rover is launching its first-ever hybrid models  the Range Rover Hybrid and Range Rover Sport Hybrid  which will deliver outstanding fuel economy, significantly 
lower CO2 emissions and retain Land Rovers renowned capability and performance. Order books in the UK will open from September 10 with first deliveries in early 2014, 
the two all-aluminium models are based on Land Rovers Premium Lightweight Architecture and share an identical powertrain.  They are the worlds first premium diesel SUV 
hybrids.
<p align="justify">
We are excited to introduce the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport Hybrids, the worlds first hybrid SUVs with legendary Land Rover capability.  The addition of a smooth 
electric drive enhances refinement, cuts CO2 emissions and delivers staggering performance on a par with our SDV8 engine, said John Edwards, Land Rover Global Brand 
Director.
To demonstrate the capabilities of the new hybrids, three Range Rover Hybrids will embark tomorrow (Thursday, August 22) on an epic trip, from the home of the Range Rover 
brand in Solihull to the home of the parent company Tata, in Mumbai, India.
This Silk Trail 2013 16,000km expedition visits 12 countries and takes in some of the worlds most challenging roads, passes and trails, including part of the ancient, 
4,000 mile Silk Road connecting Asia with the Mediterranean. These are the first hybrids to ever attempt this challenging route.
The new Range Rover Hybrid powertrain features three driver-selectable modes and combines Land Rovers popular 3-litre SDV6 diesel engine with a 35kW electric motor 
integrated with the 8-speed ZF automatic transmission.  The hybrid system, including lithium ion battery pack, inverter and electric motor weighs less than 120kg.
<p align="justify">
The electric motor produces 170Nm torque to boost acceleration and drives the vehicle in EV Mode. The motor also acts as a generator, harvesting kinetic energy through 
regenerative braking, charging the battery when the vehicle is slowing.  In driver-selectable EV mode the Range Rover Hybrid can travel at speeds of up to 30mph (48km/h) 
for a range of up to one mile (1.6km) before the diesel engine seamlessly restarts. 
Together, output of the diesel engine and electric motor is 340PS at 4,000rpm and a class-leading 700Nm torque between 1,500-3,000rpm, resulting in stunning SDV8-style 
performance.  Both models accelerate to 62mph (100km/h) in under seven seconds, deliver strong transient and mid-range performance with a top speed of 135mph (218km/h), 
combined with a 26 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions to 169g/km, equivalent to 44.1mpg on the combined cycle.
<p align="justify">
The latest generation Range Rover models have all been designed with the integration of a hybrid system in mind.  Consequently, the liquid cooled battery pack is mounted 
beneath the floor of the vehicle in a protective boron-steel cradle without impacting on the cabin or luggage space.  The Range Rover Hybrid has the same five-seat capacity 
and luggage space as the standard vehicle and retains the full-size spare wheel.  This no-compromise philosophy is echoed in the Range Rover Sport Hybrid whose interior is 
unchanged from the standard model, right down to the 5+2 seating.
Both hybrid Range Rover models continue to deliver a class-leading breadth of capability and versatility, enhanced by the exceptionally linear torque delivery from the 
powertrain and retaining Land Rovers peerless four-wheel drive system including Terrain Response® 2, with uncompromised wading and ground clearance.
<p align="justify">
The Silk Trail 2013 expedition featuring the new Range Rover Hybrids is scheduled to visit France, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
China and India.  The expedition will be broken into 10 separate legs, with the Range Rover Hybrid vehicles driven by teams of Land Rover development engineers and invited 
media  arriving in Mumbai on October 15.

<td valign="top"><h3><A NAME="20aug13">MAJOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES ENHANCE 2014 RANGE ROVER EVOQUE</A></h3>
<p align="justify"><IMG SRC="n/200813.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="195" BORDER="1" align="right" hspace="8" alt=""><b>20 August 2013</b><br>
One of the most successful Land Rover vehicles ever made, the Range Rover Evoque, makes a further leap forward with the introduction of a host of new technologies.  These 
enhancements lower fuel consumption by up to 11.4 percent and reduce CO2 emissions by up to 9.5 percent  depending on model  and bring a range of new comfort, convenience 
and connectivity features.
Customers ordering vehicles from the 2014 range, on sale in quarter four 2013 in the UK, will benefit from newly-available features, including: a new 9-speed automatic 
transmission, new driveline technologies, seven new driver assistance features and detail design enhancements inside and out.
<p align="justify">
First shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March, the ZF-9HP automatic transmission is among the worlds first 9-speed units fitted to a passenger car.  It has an ultra-fast 
response time, described by ZF as below the threshold of perception and an adaptive shift programme that quickly matches the driving style.  With a wide spread of ratios 
and improved efficiency, the new transmission delivers improved economy, reduced emissions, enhanced performance and greater comfort.
For the 2014 model, the driver assistance capabilities of Evoque are significantly enhanced by the introduction of features including: Park Exit (to automatically exit 
parallel parking bays), Perpendicular Park (to position the car centrally in parking bays), Closing Vehicle Sensing and Reverse Traffic Detection (to warn drivers of 
oncoming traffic), Lane Departure Warning, Traffic Sign Recognition and Wade Sensing.
<p align="justify">
The brand new Land Rover InControlTM connected car system, available as an option, incorporates two new features  InControlTM Remote and InControlTM Secure. 
In addition to the new technologies, there are detail changes to the Evoques exterior, new colour options for the interior, four new alloy wheel styles and a new style 
of Land Rover badge on the grille, wheel centres and tailgate.
The 2014 Evoque continues to be powered by Land Rovers range of economical and light weight four-cylinder engines with a choice of either the 2.2 diesel 150PS engine, 
2.2 diesel 190PS engine or 2.0 Petrol 240PS engine (depending on market).  With the new 9-speed automatic transmission and Active Driveline, fuel 
economy (for EU-5 compliant vehicles) is improved by up to 11.4 percent and CO2 emissions are reduced by as much as 9.5 percent.  Combined fuel consumption 
for the 2014 range is up to 57.6 mpg, with CO2 emissions starting from as low as 129 g/km.

<p align="justify"><IMG SRC="n/150813.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="162" BORDER="1" align="right" hspace="8" alt=""><b>15 August 2013</b><br>
SsangYong has announced a 5 year free servicing offer on all its light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered during August and September, which added to the existing 
market leading 5 year limitless mileage warranty, is designed to give LCV operators complete peace of mind.
The offer applies to the Korando CSX 4x4 light commercial van at £15,996 (excl VAT), the Korando Sports 4x4 double cab pick-up priced from £15,292 (excl VAT), and the 
Rexton CS 4x4 commercial van from £16,666 (excl VAT).  An automatic Rexton CS is also available at £17,666 (excl VAT).
<p align="justify">
Commented Paul Williams, CEO of SsangYong Motor UK:  While the economy may at long last be showing signs of recovery, we recognise that many small businesses, 
tradesmen and one vehicle owner-operators are struggling economically.  A lot of people are still having to make do and mend to keep their business and vehicles going, 
so this is a chance for them to get into a new vehicle with 5 years free servicing included. 
The SsangYong range is tailored for todays tough motoring conditions and our 4x4 LCV line-up of Korando, Korando Sports and Rexton are sensible, honest, well built 
vehicles that will give many years of trouble free motoring.  And backed by our 5 years warranty and 5 years free servicing offer, thats a highly reassuring package.

On Sunday 11th August over 250 Land Rovers rumbled into Beaulieu for the attractions first ever Simply Land Rover event. Anyone with a Land Rover was welcome to drive 
through the forest and join the fantastic display of Land Rovers in the grounds of the National Motor Museum.
Once they had displayed their vehicle, participants were free to enjoy the sunshine, meet other Land Rover owners and admire their vehicles, and enjoy all the features 
of the Beaulieu visitor attraction, including the National Motor Museum, BOND IN MOTION, World of Top Gear, Beaulieu Abbey, Palace House and the gardens.
<p align="justify">
Car clubs present at the event included the Solent & District Land Rover Club, which put on a wonderful display of its vehicles and the Range Rover Register.
Beaulieu also partnered with the Land Rover Experience, West Country, to offer Simply Land Rover entrants and attraction visitors the opportunity to try Beaulieus very
 own off-road Forest Drive either in their own Land Rovers or as a passenger in a Land Rover Experience vehicle. This proved to be a very popular activity, with 84 drives 
 by participants driving in their own vehicles recorded and 36 visitors either driving or having a passenger ride in the Land Rover Experience vehicles.
Throughout the day Beaulieus visitors had the opportunity to vote for their favourite vehicle on display in he Peoples Choice Awards. The winner, who received a Beaulieu 
Trophy and Land Rover mug from Beaulieus Managing Director, Russell Bowman, was Nigel Major from Christchurch with his colourful 1978 Land Rover Series III 109 fire engine. 
Nigel, who is a full-time fire-fighter at Bournemouth Airport and a retained fire-fighter at Christchurch, bought the vehicle through ebay three years ago.
<p align="justify">
Second place received a Land Rover book, courtesy of Auto Express, and three additional runners-up received Land Rover mugs. Following the awards the top-placed vehicles 
took part in a cavalcade through the grounds of the Beaulieu attraction.
Simply Land Rover is part of a growing calendar of Simply rallies which has rapidly expanded to include a wide variety of themes covering many makes and models. 
All Simply rallies are run and organised by Beaulieu and take place in the grounds of the National Motor Museum.

<p align="justify"><IMG SRC="n/050813.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="221" BORDER="1" align="right" hspace="8" alt=""><b>5 August 2013</b><br>
Land Rover Experience Scotland, the countrys leading off-road driving centre, is extending its facilities and its range of services to customers with a move to a new 
base on Butterstone Loch in the heart of the Perthshire highlands.
The new, more spacious centre is perfectly situated for easy access to challenging and highly scenic driving routes across nearby private estates. These give visitors the 
chance to learn from professional instructors just what a modern Land Rover is capable of and understand how they can get the best from the handling and drive technologies 
in their own vehicle. 
<p align="justify">
As the only Land Rover Experience centre in Scotland, it provides superb facilities, including an obstacle course, swamp, rock crawl and sand pit, as well as woodland 
tracks across 280 acres of land. Local landowners have also given the centre access to a further 5,000 acres of wild highland estates.
The new lodge building has a striking design and enjoys a beautiful setting on the shore of the 110-acre loch, which is in a Site of Special Scientific Interest, rich in 
wildlife. It provides new conference facilities, with two suites that can each accommodate up to 50 people. There is also more parking space and better accommodation for 
the administration and instruction teams than at the previous base at Dunkeld House Hotel.
<p align="justify">
Beverley Large, Land Rover Experience Scotland Director, said: The move to Butterstone Loch is a great opportunity for us to deliver an even better experience for our 
visitors, working from a larger and more flexible base. The superb setting adds an extra dimension to what we are offering, with opportunities for us to grow and offer 
new, additional activities.
Our work helps build valuable advocacy among Land Rover customers, anyone buying a new vehicle has an invitation to come to one of the seven Land Rover Experience 
centres around Britain  with ours as the only one based in Scotland. And it isnt just about the all-terrain aspects of the vehicles, our instructors cover all the 
technical aspects of the models as well, such as how to make best use of the satellite navigation and multimedia systems.
As well as customers, the centre hosts corporate and VIP guests for driving and team-building exercises. Driving packages are available from one hour to a full day, 
with groups of all sizes catered for.
The location opens up opportunities for a wider range of activities, with trout fishing available in the loch  renowned as one of Scotlands finest trout fisheries.
In spite of being set in some of Scotlands most glorious countryside, the new centre remains within easy reach, less than 15 minutes from Dunkeld village and the main A9 
north-south route. Driving time from Edinburgh airport is about an hour and a quarter, while Perth is about 35 minutes away.
<p align="justify">
As Land Rover Experience Scotland takes up residence in its new base, it also welcomes Lead Instructor Will Cox as a new director, joining Beverley Lodge and Graham 
Clark in leading the business.

    <td valign="top"><h3><A NAME="31jul13">LAND ROVERS INNOVATIVE ELECTRIC DEFENDER 
        RESEARCH PROJECT BEGINS REAL-WORLD TRIALS AT EDEN PROJECT</A></h3>
      <p align="justify"><IMG SRC="n/310713.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="220" BORDER="1" align="right" hspace="8" alt=""><b>31 
        July 2013</b><br>
        The first Electric Defender has started work at the Eden Project near 
        St Austell in Cornwall in an inaugural real world trial of its capabilities. 
        Unveiled at this years Geneva Motor Show, the Land Rover Electric Defender 
        is a pioneering research project into the electrification of an all-terrain 
        vehicle. The project forms part of Land Rovers overall sustainability 
        objectives which have included the move to aluminum platforms in the latest 
        all-new Range Rover and Range Rover Sport as well as the forthcoming Range 
        Rover hybrid products. The innovative 4x4 is a rolling laboratory to develop 
        new ideas, and investigate electrification in a real-world environment. 
        A fleet of six vehicles will be placed with organisations where their 
        performance can be assessed. 
      <p align="justify"> The Defender 110 Pick Up badged All terrain Electric 
        Research Vehicle effortlessly tows the four-carriage 12 tonne road train 
        carrying up to 60 passengers on a 6 per cent incline to and from the iconic 
        hexagonal-panelled domes. The vehicle has been designed to perform its 
        duties throughout each day before being recharged over night for the approximate 
        cost of £2.00. The Electric Defender has all the qualities and performance 
        which have become associated with the Land Rover brand during the past 
        65 years. It has full all-terrain capability, permanent 4WD and a top 
        speed of 70mph. However, it has been engineered in-house by Land Rover 
        to test out the latest sustainable technologies. The vehicles Hill Descent 
        Control is linked to a regenerative braking function, and overall up to 
        80 per cent of the cars kinetic energy can be recovered. During each 
        downhill trip at the Eden Project up to 30kW will be fed back into the 
        batteries. Land Rovers acclaimed Terrain Response system has been adapted 
        for electric drive, offering a 50-mile range with a reserve of a further 
        12.5 miles. 
      <p align="justify"> The result is a zero tailpipe emissions vehicle like 
        no other; eight hours of low-speed off-road use is achievable, and it 
        takes 10 hours for the advanced lithium-ion batteries to be fully charged. 
        Fast-charge technology reducing that to just fours is also possible. 
        Jeremy Greenwood, Principal Engineer on the Electric Defender project, 
        said the car was ideal for the sensitive ecology of the Eden Project. 
        In addition, the repetitive nature of the work will provide excellent 
        data for future electric vehicles. The car has been modified so it now 
        includes a second battery, Jeremy explained. That will allow it to work 
        a full day at the Eden Project, but also improves weight distribution 
        and stability. In addition, weve linked the land-trains air brakes to 
        the foot pedal of the Land Rover, enhancing safety. Gus Grand, Climate 
        Change Lead at the Eden Project, said: Were very pleased to be working 
        with Land Rover on this exciting project. It will be a great talking point 
        for our visitors and proves that electric vehicles can be every bit as 
        tough and rugged as their fossil fuel counterparts, while being much quieter, 
        cheaper to run and with zero emissions at the point of use.

        HIGHEST APEAL SCORE OF ANY MODEL IN ITS SEGMENT IN J.D. POWER 2013 APEAL 
        STUDY</A></h3>

        July 2013</b><br>
        According to J.D. Power 2013 Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout 
        (APEAL) Study released today, the Land Rover Range Rover achieves the 
        highest APEAL score in its segment and of any model in the industry in 
        2013, which marks the first time a model outside the large premium car 
        segment has done so. The Land Rover brand ranks 4th overall, an improvement 
        of two placements from 6th in 2012. Land Rover's Range Rover was the award 
        recipient for Large Premium Crossover/SUV in both 2010 and 2011. 
      <p align="justify"> "Its a fantastic achievement for the fourth generation 
        Range Rover to be ranked highest in the J.D. Power 2013 APEAL Study, 
        says Kim McCullough, Brand Vice President, Land Rover North America. This 
        underscores the investment being made to innovation and engineering across 
        the Land Rover product portfolio and into making this vehicle the most 
        refined, most capable Range Rover ever. The lighter and stronger 2013 
        Range Rover takes luxury and capability to a new level, with greater refinement 
        and enhanced performance and handling on all terrains. As the fourth generation 
        of the Range Rover line, this model was developed from the ground up, 
        capturing the innovative spirit and iconic design of the original model 
        which changed the world of motoring when it was launched over 40 years 
        ago. The new Range Rover was launched last October to acclaim, receiving 
        over 20 awards and accolades globally to date. It is the world's first 
        aluminum unibody SUV, weighing around 700lbs lighter than the outgoing 
        model. 
      <p align="justify"> Since going on sale this past December, the fourth generation 
        Range Rover has been received with strong demand across the U.S. Over 
        6,000 Range Rovers have been sold in the U.S. this year and sales of the 
        model have led to 28 percent year-over-year increase. The APEAL Study 
        serves as the industry benchmark for new-vehicle appeal, has been completely 
        redesigned for 2013. The study, now in its 18th year, has been updated 
        to better measure the appeal of todays vehicles, particularly with respect 
        to the new technologies and features now being offered. Owners evaluate 
        their vehicle across 77 attributes, which roll up into an overall APEAL 
        score on a 1,000-point scale. The study is used extensively by manufacturers 
        worldwide to help them design and develop more appealing vehicles and 
        by consumers to help them in their purchase decisions. The 2013 APEAL 
        Study is based on responses gathered between February and May 2013 from 
        more than 83,000 purchasers and lessees of new 2013 model-year cars and 
        light trucks who were surveyed after the first 90 days of ownership. The 
        APEAL Study complements the Initial Quality Study (IQS), which focuses 
        on problems experienced by owners during the first 90 days of ownership.

        July 2013</b><br>
        The shockingly affordable Dacia Duster is now available in a Goodwood 
        Festival of Speed special Black Edition. Having taken the UK by storm 
        since arriving at the start of this year, with over 4,000 orders to date 
        already, the award-winning smart-buy SUV now looks even meaner for the 
        price. 
      <p align="justify"> The Dacia Duster Ambiance dCi 110 4x2 Black Edition 
        is loaded with extras, including a striking brushed black vinyl wrap finish, 
        luxurious ash leather interior, hi-tech Kenwood media system and stylish 
        18 alloy wheels. The media system includes a 6 high resolution screen, 
        Garmin satellite navigation with TMC traffic information, DAB, Bluetooth 
        with hands-free calling, ipod connectivity, DVD playback and rear USB 
        connection. With an on-the-road price of just £17,575, the Romanian SUV 
        continues to blow the competition away when it comes to value for money. 
        The Black Edition was a one-off creation released to celebrate the historic 
        Goodwood Festival of Speed  the largest car culture event in the world 
        held in July. Overwhelming interest at the event has resulted in the car 
        now being available to be ordered by UK customers with first deliveries 
        from October. 
      <p align="justify"> Phil York, Dacias UK Marketing Director, said: The 
        Dacia Duster Black Edition is a mean, more upmarket version of what is 
        already a great selling vehicle. I challenge anybody to drive home such 
        a great looking SUV, with or without 4x4, with so much kit for anywhere 
        near the money. Already the nations most affordable SUV by a mile, 
        Dacia Duster is also winning over more fans after being hailed one of 
        its least depreciating new cars. Dacia, a subsidiary of the French carmaker 
        Renault, has made an enemy of the unnecessary and makes a simple range 
        of cleverly designed, high quality vehicles which unashamedly favour function 
        over frivolity. Its jaw-dropping prices are clear and straightforward, 
        whether you buy online at the Dacia Store on www.dacia.co.uk or through 
        its nationwide retailer network. Dacia only launched officially in the 
        UK in January 2013, but has already cleaned up nine major awards, including 
        a hat-trick of trophies at the carbuyer.co.uk 2013 awards, including Car 
        of Year and 4x4 of the Year, plus Scottish Car of the Year for Duster, 
        and Best Supermini under £12,000 for Sandero with What Car?.

        FOR NEW BRAND AMBASSADOR MONTY HALLS</A></h3>
      <p align="justify"><IMG SRC="n/160713.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="203" BORDER="1" align="right" hspace="8" alt=""><b>16 
        July 2013</b><br>
        Marine explorer Monty Halls presented Land Rover with an unprecedented 
        challenge to design and engineer a Dive Centre Defender. A dual purpose 
        Land Rover Defender specially equipped to provide not just transport for 
        his diving and film crews, but also to serve as a mobile base camp and 
        dive centre in remote, off-road locations. 
      <p align="justify"> Halls, a newly appointed Land Rover global ambassador, 
        admitted he didnt believe all his ambitious specifications could be met, 
        but the specialists in Land Rovers Engineered to Order (ETO) team have 
        succeeded in creating a unique vehicle tailor-made to his requirements. 
        Just as Jacques Cousteau had his trusted ship Calypso, Monty will have 
        ideal support in the form his unique Land Rover Defender. True to the 
        Defenders above and beyond ethos, Montys bespoke vehicle is packed 
        with clever engineering and design solutions that take its functionality 
        to a new level. His brief was for a vehicle that could support his diving 
        and conservation expeditions  a one-stop, go-anywhere, cope-with-anything 
        dive centre and laboratory. The modifications included features specific 
        to Montys work such as storage for diving air tanks, a VHF ship-to-shore-style 
        radio, a water tank and hosing facility for cleaning kit and provisions 
        for night working, such as external lighting. Monty also asked for a sliding 
        table, strong enough to bear up to 200kg and an awning to give protection 
        from the elements. Although he himself thought this might be impossible 
        to include, the engineering team duly delivered what he wanted. Even more 
        challenging to achieve was his requirement to be able to attach a trailer 
        to either side of the vehicle with a winch system for launching or landing 
        a dinghy. Monty is a great advocate for the brand, with years of Land 
        Rover experience gained in the field in his earlier career as a Royal 
        Marine, and in his current role as a popular and respected marine wildlife 
        and conservation expert, diver, film maker and author. He said: Ive 
        had Land Rovers for years; the association goes back to my days in the 
        Royal Marines when they were very much the vehicle of choice for doing 
        improbable tasks over impossible terrain. After leaving the marines and 
        getting into expeditions, it seems a natural transition to continue using 
        Landies. Ive had several old Defenders, a new Defender, Freelander and 
        the new Discovery, so I am a Land Rover fan through and through. 
      <p align="justify"> Although most of Montys exploration is beneath the 
        waves, the all-terrain capability of a Land Rover Defender is crucial 
        for getting him to remote locations and providing a versatile and reliable 
        base of his work in the field. Looking forward to his new ambassadorial 
        role, he said: My specialty is sea level and below, so people might think 
        my options are limited. But the reality is we have 11,000 miles of coastline 
        in the UK and frequently the only way to reach it is overland, taking 
        all your equipment with you. Monty is already planning expeditions where 
        his new Land Rover Defender will be set to work, including a project to 
        monitor basking sharks off Cornwall and observing Orca whales in Norway. 
        He explained: The vehicle will be perfect to access high points for viewing 
        their movements, as well as putting boats into the water in remote coves. 
        When he is not out in the field, Monty will also be using his new Defender 
        as part of his regular ambassador work in his touring shows and lectures 
        at schools and colleges. Mark Cameron, Land Rover Brand Experience Director 
        said: Working with Monty on this project has provided a great opportunity 
        to practically demonstrate the skill and flexibility of our engineers 
        to create bespoke customer solutions. This one off interpretation of the 
        Land Rover Defender will provide real value to Montys marine research 
        projects and of course this fits very well with Land Rovers Above and 
        Beyond spirit.

        Since its launch in 1992, the Grand Cherokee name has been delivering 
        the Jeep values of freedom, authenticity, adventure and passion. Now a 
        new model, on sale in the UK on 19 July, will continue that tradition. 
        With a new look outside and in, new cutting-edge technology and improved 
        performance on-road and off, the Grand Cherokee remains the ultimate Jeep 
        in terms of power, comfort, craftsmanship and sophistication. The British 
        market will be able to choose from two engines, three power outputs, and 
        six trim levels. But whichever model buyers pick, Jeeps trademark capability 
        will come as standard along with a raft of equipment that positions the 
        Grand Cherokee firmly at the heart of the premium SUV market. Whether 
        its the potent 3.0-litre turbo diesel or the blisteringly quick 6.4-litre 
        SRT model, every 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee will come with a new eight-speed 
        automatic transmission. This significantly reduces consumption and emissions 
        while improving acceleration and delivering smoother, faster gear changes. 
      <p align="justify"> All models have a smart new look characterised by bi-xenon 
        headlamps with LED daytime running lights (DRLs), new wheels and new colour 
        combinations. Inside, the atmosphere has been given an even more sophisticated 
        ambiance with new hand-crafted materials such as Natura Plus leather and 
        open pore Zebrano wood trim. As befits a premium model, the new Jeep Grand 
        Cherokee is packed with technology. Slipping behind the new three-spoke 
        leather-wrapped steering wheel, drivers will notice the buttons that activate 
        the cruise control and infotainment system. Ahead theres a new TFT (Thin 
        Film Transistor) 7-inch configurable driver display in the instrument 
        cluster. On the dashboard sits a new Uconnect display with an 8.4-inch 
        touchscreen. Limited Plus, Overland, Summit and SRT models have the new 
        Smartouch satellite navigation as standard; it can be specified in all 
        other models. The top-of-the-range Summit and high-performance SRT come 
        with a state-of-the-art 19-speaker, 825-watt Harman Kardon surround-sound 
        audio system. 
      <p align="justify"> A stand-out feature of all models is the comprehensive 
        array of safety equipment. This includes new Adaptive Cruise Control with 
        Stop (available late 2013), Forward Collision Warning with Crash Mitigation 
        and new Selec-Speed Control which supplement the rich array of more than 
        60 standard-fit active and passive safety systems. Legendary Jeep capability 
        comes courtesy of three four-wheel drive systems. These include the accomplished 
        Quadra-Trac II, the on-road focused and SRT-exclusive Quadra-Trac and 
        the sophisticated Quadra-Drive II with its rear Electronic Limited-Slip 
        Differential. These are complemented by the Jeep Quadra-Lift air suspension 
        and the Selec-Terrain and Selec-Trac traction management systems which 
        ensure the Grand Cherokees power is put to good use in all conditions. 
      <p align="justify"> The 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee is available in Laredo, 
        Limited, Limited Plus, Overland and the exclusive top of the range Summit 
        trim. All these models feature the 3.0-litre CRD engine which employs 
        Fiat Group Automobiles ground breaking MultiJet 2 technology for a class-leading 
        compromise between effortless power and fuel-saving efficiency. The Laredo 
        model features a lower-powered version of the CRD engine while the high-performance 
        SRT gets the punchy 6.4-litre V8 HEMI engine delivering 461 bhp. There 
        are nine colour options for exterior paintwork along with five wheel designs. 
        A raft of distinctive new colours inside ensures there really will never 
        be a dull moment in the life of the new Grand Cherokee owner

        Suzuki has a strong global heritage for its 4WD models and now, following 
        sales success in Japan as well as several European Countries including 
        Germany and Switzerland, Suzuki is launching the 4x4 Swift in the UK and 
        it goes on sale this month. Swift 4x4 will be available as a five door 
        1.2 petrol model with manual transmission and equipped as either an SZ3 
        or SZ4 grade. Apart from 4x4 badging and a slightly increased body ride 
        height of 25mm the SZ3 grade appears identical to an equivalent SZ3 five 
        door. The SZ4 model has a more rugged appearance and offers extra protection 
        over rough ground by adding front and rear skid plates, black wheel arch 
        extensions and black side skirts. 
      <p align="justify"> This new model has a proven and simple fully automatic 
        and permanent 4-wheel drive system which transfers additional torque to 
        the rear wheels when required via a viscous coupling, further enhancing 
        the already highly acclaimed cornering ability of the Swift. It is also 
        an ideal choice for customers living in rural areas needing additional 
        mobility or for crossing slippery surfaces during winter without owning 
        a larger and more conventional SUV sized vehicle. Thanks to the use of 
        small and lightweight components Swift 4x4 is just 65kg heavier than an 
        equivalent 2WD petrol model and emissions are only 10g/km higher at 126g/km. 
      <p align="justify"> Included in Suzukis recently extended VAT free offers, 
        the 4WD Swift is priced at £11,516 for SZ3 and £13,116 for the higher 
        specified SZ4 model which now includes power folding door mirrors with 
        integral indicators and Daylight Running Lamps as standard equipment.

        THE AUTO EXPRESS SUV HONOURS LIST</A></h3>

        The New Generation Santa Fe was last night hailed as Best Large SUV by 
        Auto Express after beating tough competition in the publications annual 
        New Car Awards. New Generation Santa Fe was launched in October 2012 and 
        has struck a chord with customers looking for a large SUV that delivers 
        everything expected from a premium model but in a more affordable package. 
      <p align="justify"> Steve Fowler, Editor-in-Chief of Auto Express, said: 
        The Santa Fe has done what many thought was impossible - its stopped 
        the Land Rover Discovery from winning its ninth consecutive Auto Express 
        award. We had high hopes for the Santa Fe and weren't disappointed as 
        it ticks all the boxes for buyers of large SUVs. It has the looks that'll 
        turn heads, wherever you go. It has the comfort needed for long journeys 
        or just trips to the shops. It also has the ability to tackle different 
        terrains and offers huge practicality with space for up to seven people. 
      <p align="justify"> Tony Whitehorn, CEO of Hyundai Motor UK, said: This 
        award is testament to just how far the Hyundai brand and its products 
        have come in recent years. The original Santa Fe - launched back in 2000 
        - played an important role in redefining our brand with consumers. Now, 
        New Generation Santa Fe has proven that Hyundai can compete with more 
        established brands on its own terms - and win! We think that the New 
        Generation Santa Fe will not only appeal to existing customers with its 
        fresh design and improved levels of standard technology, but will attract 
        a new range of buyers looking for a stylish, premium and authentic SUV. 
        New Generation Santa Fe went on sale in the UK on October 2012 and is 
        powered by a 197PS 2.2-litre CRDi engine mated to six-speed manual or 
        automatic transmission, returning up to 47.9mpg on the combined cycle 
        with CO2 emissions as low as 155g/km. Three trim levels are available, 
        with five- and seven-seat configurations offered. New Generation Santa 
        Fes suspension has been tuned specifically for UK roads to ensure a refined 
        and cosseting ride, and the SUV was named the safest car in its class 
        assessed by Euro NCAP during 2012, with the best scores in the Large 
        Off-Road 4x4 class

        HONOUR AT THE 2013 AUTO EXPRESS AWARDS</A></h3>
      <p align="justify"><IMG SRC="n/0307132.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="206" BORDER="1" align="right" hspace="8" alt=""><b>3 
        July 2013</b><br>
        Volkswagens highly-acclaimed Amarok has scooped the award for Best Pick-Up 
        for the second consecutive year at the Auto Express New Car Awards. Praised 
        for its styling, carrying capacity, efficient engines and high-quality 
        interior the Amarok remains the vehicle of choice in the pick-up sector. 
        Auto Express, Britains biggest-selling weekly car magazine, held its 
        New Car Awards last night in London. Announcing the results before a VIP 
        industry audience the magazines Editor in Chief, Steve Fowler, said: 
        Volkswagen might be a relative newcomer to the world of pick-ups, but 
        with the Amarok its produced a real winner. There are no compromises 
        with an Amarok  it has the carrying capacity and ease of use that makes 
        light work of heavy loads, yet up front there are all the creature comforts 
        and driving attributes weve come to expect from Volkswagen. 
      <p align="justify"> Commenting on the award Alex Smith, Director of Volkswagen 
        Commercial Vehicles, added: Since its launch in 2011 the Amarok has redefined 
        what buyers can expect from a hard-working, durable and reliable pick-up. 
        Demand continues to grow year-on-year, which is a trend we expect to continue 
        thanks to the launch of the ultra-stylish, limited-run Amarok edition. 
        Winning this award for two consecutive years is an enormous achievement 
        and testament to the quality of the vehicle. Using Volkswagens latest 
        2.0-litre common rail diesel engine to bring new levels of refinement 
        and efficiency to the pick-up market, the Amarok is just as powerful as, 
        and more efficient than, rivals that use larger capacity units. It also 
        has some of the lowest emissions in the sector, and was the first to dip 
        under the 200 g/km CO2 threshold. The Amarok range offers three trim levels, 
        a choice of permanent or selectable 4MOTION, and a load area wide enough 
        to fit a euro pallet. 
      <p align="justify"> Since May 2012 the Amarok has been built at Volkswagen 
        Commercial Vehicles factory in Hanover, Germany, reducing delivery times 
        for UK buyers. Prices start from £19,365 (excluding VAT). For full details 
        of the Amarok visit <a href="http://www.volkswagen-vans.co.uk" target="_blank">www.volkswagen-vans.co.uk</a>

        Land Rover vehicles have again proved they can do battle with the best, 
        scooping three top prizes at the annual Auto Express Awards. The all-new 
        Range Rover was voted Best Luxury Car by the judging panel, which consists 
        of the magazines road testers and other senior staff members. Steve Fowler, 
        Auto Express Editor-in-Chief commented: The new Range Rover is an awesome 
        achievement, combining the highest standards of luxury with a hitherto 
        impossible blend of on-road comfort and off-road ability. To do all that 
        with such style and efficiency makes it a worthy winner. The Range Rover 
        also won Auto Express Design Award, voted for by magazine readers and 
        website visitors. More than 80 production cars and concept vehicles were 
        eligible, yet the Range Rover came out on top. Steve Fowler added: Its 
        testimony to the work Land Rover Design Director Gerry McGovern and his 
        team have done in reinventing this motoring icon, especially when you 
        see the long list of beautiful cars the Range Rover beat. 
      <p align="justify"> Land Rover Design Director and Chief Creative Officer, 
        Gerry McGovern said: "Designing the All-New Range Rover for a new era 
        was always going to be a significant challenge; particularly finding the 
        right balance between maintaining its iconic form while giving it greater 
        relevance and modernity. It also had to sit comfortably as the flagship 
        of a whole new generation of Range Rovers. This award is particularly 
        significant to us at Land Rover as it is voted for by the Auto Express 
        readers themselves and reflects the efforts of everyone in the Land Rover 
        Design Team." The all-new Range Rover is the most capable and most luxurious 
        Land Rover yet. Up to 420 kilogrammes lighter with new levels of refinement, 
        the Range Rover reinforces its position as the world's finest luxury SUV. 
        Not to be left out was the Range Rover Evoque, which was awarded the honour 
        of Best Compact SUV. Its the magazines former Car of the Year and 
        is receiving an Auto Express trophy for the third year in a row. Steve 
        Fowler commented: Its star is showing no sign of dimming. We love its 
        style, quality and ability on and off-road. It remains one of the most 
        desirable cars on sale in the UK today. 
      <p align="justify"> With more than 130 global awards under its belt, the 
        Evoque has gained critical acclaim from customers and media alike. The 
        Evoque continues to receive plaudits for its concept car looks, dynamic 
        driving performance, class leading off-road skills and excellent cost 
        of ownership. Most recently, a Special Edition Evoque was launched in 
        the UK which is available in coupé and 5-door, customers can choose from 
        two exterior colour schemes, each one unique to the Special Edition model 
        and based on a new Black Design Pack. Choices include a Sicilian Yellow 
        exterior body finish with a Santorini Black contrast roof, or a Santorini 
        Black exterior body finish with a Sicilian Yellow contrast roof and door 
        mirrors. Unique interior finishes include yellow contrast stitching on 
        seats, central storage area, door trims and fascia mid-section, plus an 
        anodised yellow horizontal finisher. 
      <p align="justify"> The awards were announced at a gala event at the Grand 
        Connaught Rooms, in Londons Covent Garden. Jeremy Hicks, Managing Director 
        for Jaguar Land Rover UK commented: Three trophies in one night is a 
        fantastic achievement, but whats especially pleasing is they each recognise 
        distinct aspects of our business. The Range Rover has set new standards 
        in luxury, the Evoque continues to be the benchmark car for compact SUVs, 
        and industry leading design will always be at the heart of everything 
        we do.
