<h4><a name="app2" id="app2">Under what circumstances will an Accessible Parking Permit be issued?</a></h4>

<p>Permanent, subject to change (up to 5 years), or a temporary permit (up to 12 months) will be issued to an individual who meets the following eligibility criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cannot walk without assistance of another person or a brace, cane, crutch, a lower limb prosthetic device or similar assistive device or who requires the assistance of a wheelchair.</li>

	<li>Suffers from lung disease to such an extent that forced expiratory volume in one second is less than 1 litre.</li>

	<li>Portable oxygen is a medical necessity.</li>

	<li>Cardiovascular disease impairment classified as Class III or Class IV to standards accepted by the American Heart Association or Class III or IV according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Standard.</li>

	<li>Severely limited in the ability to walk due to an arthritic, neurological, musculoskeletal or orthopaedic condition.</li>

	<li>Visual acuity is 20/200 or poorer in the better eye with or without corrective lenses or whose greatest diameter of the field of vision in both eyes is 20 degrees or less.</li>

	<li>Condition(s) or functional impairment that severely limits his or her mobility.</li>
</ul>

<p>His or her condition must be certified by an Accessible Parking Permit (<abbr>APP</abbr>) program recognized health practitioner (physician, chiropractor, registered nurse practitioner (extended class), physiotherapist, occupational therapist, chiropodist or podiatrist)</p>

<p>Please note that a person's age does not qualify him or her for a permit. You may apply for an APP even if you do not own a car or have a driver's licence. These permits are issued to individuals, not vehicles. A &quot;portable permit&quot; issued to a person with a disability ensures their ease of access from any vehicle at any time.</p>

<p>There is no charge for Accessible Parking Permits. The Ministry of Transportation is committed to breaking down barriers for people with disabilities throughout Ontario.</p>

<h4><a name="app3" id="app3">How does a visitor to Ontario obtain an Accessible Parking Permit?</a></h4>


	<p>Ontario honours accessible parking permits, licence plates, markers or devices, bearing the international symbol for access for the person with a disability from other jurisdictions. You do not need to apply for a visitor permit if you are travelling with one of the above.</p>
<p>	  However, if you are disabled but do not have one of the above, please call ServiceOntario's Driver and Vehicle Contact Centre at 416 235-2999 or toll free at 1-800-387-3445 (Canada wide) to obtain information on how to apply for a visitor's Accessible Parking Permit.  </p>
	<p>    These permits ensure that people with disabilities have a unique entitlement to designated accessible parking throughout Ontario (specific parking privileges vary depending on the municipality or parking lot owner). ServiceOntario issues Accessible Parking Permits to out-of-province visitors for a maximum of six months.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ontario honours accessible parking permits, licence plates, markers or devices, bearing the international symbol for access for the person with a disability from other jurisdictions. You do not need to apply for a visitor permit if you are travelling with one of the above.</p>

<h4><a name="Collision_Reporting_Centres1" id="Collision_Reporting_Centres1">What are Collision Reporting Centres?</a></h4>

<p>A Collision Reporting Centre is a facility created to help motorists in reporting motor vehicle collisions. This service is currently available in a number of urban centres. No fees are charged.</p>

<h4><a name="Collision_Reporting_Centres2" id="Collision_Reporting_Centres2">What actions should I take before going to a Collision Reporting Centre?</a></h4>

<ol>
	<li><strong>If it is safe to do so</strong>, remove vehicles from the roadway.</li>

	<li>Call Police to ensure police presence is not required and obtain the location of the closest Collision Reporting Centre.</li>

	<li>Exchange information with the other involved parties, including independent witnesses. (Names, addresses, phone numbers, insurance companies and vehicle particulars, etc.).</li>

	<li>As soon as possible, bring your vehicle to the Collision Reporting Centre most convenient to you.</li>

	<li>Bring documentation with you to the Collision Reporting Centre (e.g. driver's licence, ownership and insurance, etc.).</li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="Collision_Reporting_Centres3" id="Collision_Reporting_Centres3">When should I go to a Collision Reporting Centre?</a></h4>

<p>With the following exceptions, any driver involved in a collision where damage to vehicles or property is more than $1,000 may report the collision to a Collision Reporting Centre. Police will come to the scene when one or more of the following situations apply.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Collisions involving injury or death.</li>

	<li>Criminal activity involved in collisions (e.g., impaired driving, stolen vehicle, assault, etc.).</li>

	<li>Collisions involving federal, provincial or municipal vehicles (including transit vehicles).</li>

	<li>Collisions involving a person who is uninsured or is a suspended driver.</li>

	<li>Collisions involving vehicles transporting dangerous goods.</li>

	<li>Collisions involving damage to private, municipal or highway property.</li>

</ul>

<h4><a name="ssc1" id="ssc1">What precautions should I take before I purchase a used vehicle?</a></h4>

<p>As with any major purchase, you may wish to have the vehicle inspected prior to purchasing. You should take it to a certified mechanic that you trust and have them inspect it before you make the purchase. The mechanic may find defects that are not covered under the regulations relating to a Safety Standards Certificates (<abbr>SSC</abbr>) that may be costly to repair in the near future.</p>

<h4><a name="ssc2" id="ssc2">What is a Safety Standard Certificate (<abbr>SSC</abbr>)?</a></h4>

<p>An SSC is a certificate that is issued by a government- approved Motor Vehicle Inspection Station (<abbr>MVIS</abbr>) after a vehicle passes an inspection. This inspection covers the minimum safety requirements for vehicles in the province of Ontario.</p>

<h4><a name="ssc3" id="ssc3">When do I require an SSC?</a></h4>

<p>An SSC is required when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>registering a rebuilt motor vehicle;</li>

	<li>transferring a used motor vehicle to a new owner as fit;</li>

	<li>registering a motor vehicle in Ontario that was previously registered in another province or country;</li>

	<li>changing the status of a vehicle from unfit to fit.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="ssc4" id="ssc4">Is an SSC a warranty on my vehicle purchase?</a></h4>

<p>An SSC is not a warranty or guarantee on the general condition of the vehicle. The SSC only certifies that on the date it was issued, the vehicle met the minimum safety standards as set down by Regulation 611 of Ontario's Highway Traffic Act (<abbr>HTA</abbr>).</p>

<h4><a name="ssc5" id="ssc5">Where do I get a vehicle inspected?</a></h4>

<p>You can have your vehicle inspected at a Ministry of Transportation-approved Motor Vehicle Inspection Station (<abbr>MVIS</abbr>). There are approximately 13,500 stations across Ontario, just look for the green and white sign that says &quot;Ontario Motor Vehicle Inspection Station&quot;. MTO does not make recommendations regarding the choice of Motor Vehicle Inspection Stations to perform inspections. The choice is yours.</p>

<h4><a name="ssc6" id="ssc6">How much does an inspection cost?</a></h4>

<p>The ministry does not govern the cost of either inspections or any repairs. It might, therefore, be beneficial to &quot;shop around&quot; and compare prices and service.</p>

<h4><a name="ssc7" id="ssc7">How long is an SSC valid for?</a></h4>

<p>For the purposes of transferring ownership, an SSC is valid for 36 days from the day that the SSC was issued.</p>

<h4><a name="ssc8" id="ssc8">What if I believe the inspection of a vehicle I just purchased was carried out improperly?</a></h4>

<p>You should do the following three steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Check the regulations and ensure that the defect is an inspection requirement under the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_900611_e.htm">Highway Traffic Act - R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 611</a> Schedules 1 through 9, whichever applies to the type of vehicle inspected.</li>

	<li>If you still believe the vehicle inspection was carried out improperly, you are encouraged to have your vehicle re-inspected at another MVIS location. Be sure to request they provide you with a list of items, including applicable measurements that do not meet the minimum SSC requirements. This information will support a possible ministry investigation.</li>

	<li>If the results of the second inspection indicate the inspection was not properly conducted, you can contact your local Ministry of Transportation enforcement office as listed in the blue pages of your local telephone book (see “Drivers and Vehicles”).</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to support a possible ministry investigation, <strong>do not</strong> have the defective vehicle components changed, modified or repaired before you discuss your situation with an officer at your local MTO enforcement office.</p>

<p>If an enforcement officer inspects your vehicle and finds that the vehicle could not have met the minimum requirements on the day of inspection, then a charge may be laid against the garage/mechanic that did the inspection. The fine range upon conviction is from $400 to $20,000.</p>

<p>If the officer inspects your vehicle and finds that it has critical defects, the vehicle must be repaired before it is put back on the road. If the vehicle is not going to be repaired at the location where the officer inspected it, then the officer will remove the plates and will put the vehicle in “unfit” status.</p>

<p>When requested, the ministry will supply the vehicle owner with a copy of the inspection results. The ministry cannot force an MVIS station to pay for any repairs on a vehicle to bring it into compliance. To recoup any out-of-pocket expenses that were required to make the vehicle comply with the minimum safety requirements, you may choose to seek legal advice and/or consider civil action against the MVIS station/mechanic.</p>

<h4><a name="ssc9" id="ssc9">What if I have a problem with a vehicle I purchased from a dealer and the item is not covered under the minimum requirements of the SSC?</a></h4>

<p>If you purchased or leased your vehicle through a dealer, you may be able to receive assistance from the agency that regulates used vehicle dealers in Ontario. If you purchased or leased it from a dealer, contact the <a href="http://www.omvic.on.ca/">Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council</a> (<abbr>OMVIC</abbr>) to get information about your rights and responsibilities. OMVIC also offers a complaint handling service on their website.</p>

<h4><a name="ssc10" id="ssc10">What should I do if I have a problem with a repair that was carried out at a garage and I feel it was not done properly or was not required, or if an SSC inspection was carried out and the garage included items that were not required by the regulation to make it pass?</a></h4>

<p>This scenario is not addressed by the Highway Traffic Act or its regulations but it is addressed under the Ministry of Government Services and you can contact them at <a href="http://www.mgs.gov.on.ca/english/index.html">www.mgs.gov.on.ca</a></p>

<h4><a name="ssc11" id="ssc11">Do I have to have my vehicle repaired at the MVIS where the initial inspection was completed?</a></h4>

<p>No, but if you do not wish to incur any additional inspection fees you must return the vehicle to the station for re-inspection of the repaired items and issuance of the SSC. In this case, no additional fee will be charged for re-inspection, providing that the wheel brake assemblies do not have to be inspected a second time.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The vehicle must be returned to the MVIS <strong>within 10 calendar days</strong> with the specified defects repaired to qualify for re-inspection at no charge.</p>

<h4><a name="fees2" id="fees2">What is considered Northern Ontario?</a></h4>

<p>Under the Highway Traffic Act, a person residing in Northern Ontario means a person who ordinarily resides in the Territorial District of Muskoka, Algoma, Cochrane, Kenora, Manitoulin, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, Sudbury, Thunder Bay or any part of the Territorial District of Nipissing lying North or West of Algonquin Provinical Park.</p>

<p>Payments can be made using cash, certified personal cheque, debit card, VISA, MasterCard, American Express or money order.</p>

<h4><a name="sticker1" id="sticker1">I have lost or damaged my vehicle plate sticker. How can I get it replaced?</a></h4>

<p>The ministry will replace a validation sticker for $7 if it is lost, stolen, damaged or removed by enforcement staff. If it is faulty or lost in the mail, it will be replaced free of charge, if reported within 31 days from the date the initial sticker was issued.</p>

<p>Visit the nearest <a href="http://www.ontario.ca/en/services_for_residents/STEL02_155833">ServiceOntario Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office</a> and complete an Application For Registration. Bring the damaged sticker (if applicable), name of insurance company and policy number, and reason for requesting a replacement.</p>

<h4><a name="sticker2" id="sticker2">Where can I renew my sticker?</a></h4>

<p>You can renew your sticker at any <http://www.ontario.ca/en/services_for_residents/STEL02_155833>
  ServiceOntario Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office</a>  or online at <a href="http://www.gov.on.ca/ont/portal/!ut/p/.cmd/cs/.ce/7_0_A/.s/7_0_252/_s.7_0_A/7_0_252/_l/en?docid=053272">ServiceOntario Driver and Vehicle Online Services</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="sticker3" id="sticker3">When do I need to renew my sticker?</a></h4>

<p>For your convenience, a licence plate renewal application will be mailed to you approximately 60 to 90 days prior to the plate expiry (usually on your birthdate).</p>
<p>You must renew your plate before the sticker expires.  You may also renew six months before the sticker expires.  In this case, the Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office will print a renewal application for you.<br />
</p>
<p>A  licence plate bearing current validation (sticker) must be attached to a vehicle before the vehicle can be legally driven in Ontario. Plates are validated by obtaining and affixing a  sticker as described on the carrier form on which the stickers are attached.</p>
<h4><a name="sticker4" id="sticker4">How long can I renew for?</a></h4>

<p>You can renew your licence plate validation for a period of one or two years. If your vehicle needs a <a href="http://www.driveclean.com/">Drive Clean</a> test in the second year, you may not be able to renew for more than one year.</p>

<p>Motorcycles, motor assisted bicycles, snow vehicles, passenger vehicles, or light commercial vehicles with a registered gross weight of 3,000 kilograms or less are eligible for a two year renewal.</p>

<h4><a name="sticker5" id="sticker5">What is an odometer reading?</a></h4>

<p>An odometer reading is the record of the total kilometres driven by your vehicle. It is usually located on your vehicle's dashboard.</p>

<h4><a name="sticker6" id="sticker6">What do I do with my sticker once I get it?</a></h4>

<p>Plates are validated by obtaining and affixing a validation sticker to your vehicle's rear licence plate or front plate for a commercial vehicle. The sticker comes with instructions, please affix as indicated.</p>

<h2><a>Online Service:</a></h2>

<h4><a name="online1" id="online1">How do I order my renewal sticker online?</a></h4>

<p>As a courtesy, the ministry will send you a renewal notice approximately 60 to 90 days before your renewal date. You may wish to refer to this document when you  renew online. You can renew your sticker online at <a href="http://www.gov.on.ca/ont/portal/!ut/p/.cmd/cs/.ce/7_0_A/.s/7_0_252/_s.7_0_A/7_0_252/_l/en?docid=053272">ServiceOntario Driver and Vehicle Online Services</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="online2" id="online2">What information do I need to order my sticker online?</a></h4>

<p>You will need the following information to order your sticker online:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your vehicle plate number,</li>

	<li>your insurance  company's name and policy number,</li>

  <li>odometer reading</li>

	<li>fees shown on your plate renewal application.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time of renewal, any outstanding parking fines and NSF cheques must be paid in full — and can be paid online — before your order is processed and a sticker is issued.</p>

<p>A vehicle emissions pass report or a conditional pass report may be required. Ontario's <a href="http://www.driveclean.com/">Drive Clean</a> Program applies to owners of passenger and light-duty vehicles registered in the Drive Clean Program area. Ontario also requires all diesel-powered heavy duty trucks and buses province-wide to pass an annual Drive Clean emissions test. All non-diesel heavy-duty vehicles require annual tests if they are registered in the designated Drive Clean light-duty vehicle program area. For more information on the Drive Clean Program, call the Drive Clean Call Centre at 905-440-7482.</p>

<h4><a name="online3" id="online3">How do I know if I need a Drive Clean test?</a></h4>

<p>You can check whether or not your vehicle needs a test by visiting the <a href="http://www.driveclean.com/">Drive Clean</a> website. Click on &quot;Do I need a test?&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="online4" id="online4">I think I have fines on my vehicle licence plate. Can I still order my sticker online?</a></h4>

<p>When a plate owner has failed to pay his or her parking fines or other related outstanding fees (such as an NSF), certain vehicle-related transactions, such as renewing a plate sticker, will not be permitted until the fines are paid.</p>

<p>The Ministry of the Attorney General posts outstanding parking fines  against licence plates. The outstanding parking fine amount is listed on the Vehicle Licence Renewal Application. If you have any questions about your fine status, please call your local provincial court.</p>

<p>Full payment may be made online when you order your sticker. The denial is lifted when the outstanding amount has been fully paid.</p>

<h4><a name="online5" id="online5">How will I know if my particular order has been accepted?</a></h4>

<p>If the online plate renewal is successfully processed, you will be able to view the confirmation of your order online. You should keep this confirmation number for your records in case you have not received your renewed sticker and you need to follow-up on this matter.</p>

<h4><a name="online6" id="online6">How long will it be before I receive my sticker?</a></h4>

<p>Allow 5 business days for the delivery of your sticker.</p>

</ul><br />

<h4><a name="studs1" id="studs1">Who can use studded tires?</a></h4>

<p>Northern residents living north of and including Parry Sound and Nipissing Districts can now use studded tires on their vehicles.</p>

<h4><a name="studs2" id="studs2">When can I use my studded tires?</a></h4>

<p>Northern Ontario residents can use studded tires with lightweight studs, anywhere in Ontario, from October 1 to April 30 inclusive. Using illegal studs, driving outside the legal time period, and Southern Ontario residents using studs on their vehicles can result in fines of up to $1,000.</p>

<h4><a name="studs3" id="studs3">How much does it cost to purchase a studded tire?</a></h4>

<p>On average, a studdable tire could cost anywhere from $90 - $150 per tire or more depending on the make and size of the tire. This is similar to the cost of a winter tire. The price for studding a tire is typically $25 per tire and up.</p>

<h4><a name="studs4" id="studs4">Where can I get studded tires?</a></h4>

<p>Studded tires are now available and can be ordered by your local tire installer or supplier in Northern Ontario. Follow manufacturers' recommendations for installation, maintenance and operations</p>

<h4><a name="studs5" id="studs5">What type of studs can I use?</a></h4>

<p>Only lightweight Scandinavian studs can be used in Northern Ontario. The maximum stud weight for each type of vehicle is regulated.</p>

<h4><a name="studs6" id="studs6">Where can I get more information on the type of studded tires I can use in Northern Ontario?</a></h4>

<p>Detailed information is included in Regulation 625 and is available through E-Laws: <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_900625_e.htm">Highway Traffic Act - Tire Standards and Specifications</a></p>

<h4><a name="studs7" id="studs7">Do out-of-province visitors face fines if they have heavy (steel) studs on their vehicles?</a></h4>

<p>No, as long as they do not stay longer than 30 days. The stud weight regulation does not apply to visitors. Similarly to Northern residents, they can use studded tires, in the legal period, anywhere in Ontario.</p>

<h4><a name="used1" id="used1">How can I find out about the Red Book value for my car?</a></h4>

<p>The Red Book, which contains vehicle values, is published by Canadian Red Book Inc. This book or a similar one is available at most book stores and at retail automotive centres. To obtain the Red Book value of a vehicle, you need to look up the year, make and model of the vehicle in question. The wholesale value is the one most commonly used for retail sales tax purposes. The Used Vehicle Information Package uses this retail value for transferring ownership of a vehicle on a private sale. If you wish to purchase the official Red Book you can reach them by calling 905-469-6468.</p>

<h4><a name="used2" id="used2">Where can I get copies of the ministry's vehicle auction schedule and a list of vehicles to be auctioned off?</a></h4>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation no longer runs the government vehicle auction program. As part of its efforts to build partnerships with the private sector, the ministry has transferred delivery of this program to a private company, Manheim Auctions.</p>

<h4><a name="uninsured1" id="uninsured1">What is the Uninsured Vehicles Project (UVP)?</a></h4>

<p>The Uninsured Vehicles Project (UVP) is a joint initiative between the Ontario government and the Insurance Bureau of Canada to allow the verification of mandatory automobile insurance coverage at the time of plate renewal in an effort to reduce the number of uninsured vehicles on Ontario's roads. </p>

<h4><a name="uninsured2" id="uninsured2">Why do I need to have insurance?</a></h4>

<p>Under the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act, it's the law for all vehicles in Ontario to have valid insurance coverage. Drivers are required to provide proof of valid insurance when renewing their vehicle's licence plates.  </p>

<h4><a name="uninsured3" id="uninsured3">When will UVP come into effect?</a></h4>

<p>Starting November 29, 2010 Ontario will be able to electronically verify, with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, if a vehicle has valid insurance coverage during the licence plate renewal process.  </p>

<h4><a name="uninsured4" id="uninsured4">What authority does the Province have to verify my insurance coverage?  </a></h4>

<p>The authority of the Ministry of Transportation to verify insurance 
information is provided for under the <em>Compulsory Automobile 
Insurance Act</em>.</p>

<h4><a name="uninsured5" id="uninsured5">How will the Ministry of Transportation be able  to query if Ontarians have valid insurance??</a></h4>

<p>Under the UVP, the Ministry of Transportation  sends the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) electronically to the Insurance  Bureau of Canada's insurance database, to query a vehicle’s mandatory insurance  coverage.</p>

<h4><a name="uninsured6" id="uninsured6">What if I don't have insurance?</a></h4>

<p>Those who do not have valid insurance will not be eligible for licence plate validation renewal unless they have obtained the required mandatory vehicle insurance coverage. Drivers whose insurance cannot not be confirmed should contact an insurance provider or broker for further details or clarification. </p>

<h4><a name="uninsured7" id="uninsured7">What is the 120-day letter?</a></h4>

<p>As part of the Ministry's insurance verification process, vehicle owners who have unconfirmed insurance or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) issues will be notified in writing 120 days prior to their licence plate expiration date, allowing time to correct or update their information. These notices will direct customers with either a VIN or insurance information issue  how to correct this information prior to their plate renewal in order to avoid problems when processing their plate renewal transaction. </p>

<h4><a name="uninsured8" id="uninsured8">I have insurance but I received the 120-day letter. What does this mean?</a></h4>

<p>Customers with valid insurance coverage who received the 120-day letter, may have potential issues with their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and/or their insurance information could not be properly verified. If a problem with your VIN has been identified, please refer to the insert enclosed with your letter, or click on this link www.Ontario.ca/vehicleinfo,or contact your insurance provider or broker for further clarification. </p>

<h4><a name="uninsured9" id="uninsured9">I didn't receive the 120-day letter. What does this mean?</a></h4>

<p>The 120-day letters are only sent to those individuals where valid insurance coverage could not be verified, or there is an issue with their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), or a combination of both scenarios. </p>

<h4><a name="uninsured10" id="uninsured10">Where can I get more information about UVP?</a></h4>

<p>Get more information on <a href="https://www.services.gov.on.ca/services/start.do?action=services">vehicle permit renewal services</strong></a>.</strong>  You can also contact the ServiceOntario Driver and Vehicle Contact Centre at (416) 235-2999 (GTA) or toll free in Canada at 1-800-387-3445.

      <li> A fine of up to $25,000 for a first offence </li>
      <li>A fine of up to $50,000 for a second offence, and the possibility of a driver's licence suspension for up to one year. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h4><a name="uninsured12" id="uninsured12">How has the Province been validating my insurance in the past?</a></h4>
