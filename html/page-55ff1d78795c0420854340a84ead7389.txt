				<h3>Not Found on eBay: 1965 Ford Mustang Station
Wagon</h3>
<h4>Auto enthusiasts have been arguing the merits and
viability--even the very existence--of a Mustang-based station
wagon for 45 years. Now, RK Motors is putting a bona fide example on
the block... a one-off Mustang 5.0 Shooting Brake.</h4>
<p><i>By
Richard Truesdell</i></p>

<p>The
near-mythical Mustang Station Wagon... Talk of this unusual vehicle
has persisted in automotive circles since the earliest days of the
Mustang, and Ford even had proposals for it on the drawing board. Yet
the very first Mustang Station Wagon was not, in fact, built by the
Ford Motor Co.</p>

<p>Rather, it
was a secret project given to Italian coachbuilder Intermeccanica by
Barney Clark, an executive at J. Walter Thompson, Ford&#39;s
advertising agency. And it was renowned designer Bob Cumberford whose
pen devised the original Mustang Station Wagon&#39;s look. (Yes, the
same Bob Cumberford who has been the design editor of <i>Automobile
Magazine</i> since its inception in 1986.)</p>

<p>Constructed
in 1965, the Clark/Cumberford car may or may not still exist, but
photographs and magazine articles from the period have inspired a few
talented craftsmen to try their hands at creating their own Mustang
Station Wagons.</p>

<p>The
striking 1965 wagon seen here was built by Joe Kamp, who used as many
factory components as possible to create one of the most unique and
eye-catching Mustangs you&#39;ll ever see.</p>

<p>No
showpiece, this Mustang Wagon was designed to be driven. It has been
extensively reengineered for its role as a high-performance vehicle.</p>

<p>Using 100
percent steel to create the wagon body meant finding a clean original
Mustang hardtop to use as a foundation. The original roof was cut,
lengthened, slightly widened, and installed with sections of the
original C-pillars out back.</p>

<p>Kamp used
the original hardtop pieces and deck lid to construct the tailgate
and rear window. He fabricated side windows and trimmed them with
factory-period chrome molding. The vehicle&#39;s proportions are
excellent, with a sporty rake to the roofline that fits Mustang&#39;s
performance image.</p>

<p>The rear
quarter windows were retained as well. The integration into the
original quarter panels is seamless, and the factory deck lid was
extensively modified to finish the rear of the car with a factory
look.</p>

<p>Brilliant
red paint covers the beautiful wagon&#39;s shape, showing off the
special metalwork and expert fabrication. With the addition of gold
Shelby-style stripes and a fiberglass hood with an integrated scoop,
Kamp made this vehicle an interesting study in &quot;what ifs.&quot;</p>

<p>His finish
work is as good as any restoration, combining the finest qualities of
a hand-made one-off and a factory-built car.</p>

<p>To keep
the Mustang looking like a Mustang, all the original chrome was
retained, including the slender front and rear bumpers and Mustang&#39;s
trademark three-element taillights. The front&nbsp;sports a
Shelby-style grille with offset pony emblem, and all the original
stainless trim was polished. Shelby stripes were used on the rockers.</p>

<p>Kamp opted
to advertise the engine under the hood: Ford&#39;s venerable 302-c.u.,
five-liter V8. The mighty 5.0 is second only to the small-block Chevy
in terms of adaptability, longevity, and the size of its aftermarket
parts industry.</p>

<p>Externally
the same size as the original 289, the V8 is an easy fit in the early
Mustang&#39;s engine bay, looking quite OEM sitting there between those
vintage wheel wells.</p>

<p>Beautifully
detailed, but with an eye to making it look like the factory built
it, Kamp&#39;s 1965 Mustang Wagon is finished without excessive chrome
or aftermarket pieces.</p>

<p>Instead of
taking the easy way out by planting a carburetor atop the engine, he
even retained the entire Ford EEC-IV engine management system,
including the mass-air induction system.</p>

<p>As a
result, the wagon runs and drives like a late-model Mustang, with a
recognizable exhaust note and a smooth flow of torque that&#39;s a 5.0
specialty. Note how nicely the stock 5.0 airbox was integrated into
the early Mustang&#39;s inner fenders, the way the A/C was adapted to
work inside the vintage body, and the chassis-stiffening braces that
clear the V8&#39;s intake manifold and distributor as if they were
designed to work together. The modern radiator keeps it all cool,
assisted by a massive electric fan.</p>

<p>Building
on the late-model drivetrain, the transmission is a T5 five-speed
manual, topped by a Hurst shifter and fitted with a new heavy-duty
clutch. The rear is a Ford eight-inch sporting 3.00 gears, making
this wagon an exceptional highway cruiser.</p>

<p>Stock-style
suspensions front and rear are consistent with the overall Mustang
originality, and Kamp carefully reinforced the chassis to handle the
wagon&#39;s extra power. He fabricated custom control arms for the rear
axle to handle the added torque and installed new shocks and
suspension pieces throughout.</p>

<p>Power disc
brakes deliver modern stopping performance to match the engine&#39;s
output, and a factory-looking and sounding dual exhaust system was
installed. A set of original Mustang alloy wheels has been fitted,
wearing 215/70/15 BFGoodrich T/A radials.</p>

<p>The
interior is just as unusual as the body, with a bench-style front
seat that seems perfectly matched to a wagon. Kamp installed a custom
center console, filler between the seats giving the illusion of a
bench with the comfort of buckets.</p>

<p>He covered
the seat in a brown vinyl that looks right at home in this Sixties
classic, and the tan used on the dash and kick panels is elegant and
upscale. White door panels and headliner make it bright and airy
inside, an effect enhanced by the large rear side windows.</p>

<p>The back
seat is as big as the one in a standard Mustang coupe, so you
shouldn&#39;t be afraid to grab a few friends when you take this
beautiful car out for a cruise. Kamp neatly integrated the A/C into
the dash with a few discreet vents, and the original AM radio remains
in the center of the dashboard (a powerful AM/FM/CD stereo was built
into the console below it). Brown carpets in both the passenger
compartment and the cargo area tie the interior together in a highly
OEM fashion.</p>

<p>The fate
of the original Mustang Station Wagon remains a mystery. Some say it
is rotting in a field somewhere. Others claim it was crushed by Ford.</p>

<p>The 1965
Mustang Station Wagon built by Joe Kamp is likely the finest example
of this long-lost idea still in existence. Thoroughly engineered with
a powerful, updated drivetrain, it rides and handles like a
factory-built car, with a structure that is impressively tight and
strong.</p>

<p>A fun,
practical, stylish, and very attention-getting car, this wagon is
about as unique an automotive experience as you can have. To put this
one-of-one Mustang in your corral, call Joseph Carroll at RK Motors

<h6>Sidebar: The First Mustang Station Wagon</h6>
<p>The first
Mustang Station Wagon appeared on the cover of the October 1966 issue
of <i>Car and Driver</i>
(which, at the time, cost a mere 60 cents). It was born of the
fertile mind of Barney Clark, an advertising executive at J. Walter
Thompson (now JWT and still Ford&#39;s agency of record).</p>

<p>Clark&#39;s
co-conspirator in this scheme was Robert Cumberford, an up-and-coming
designer who had worked at GM, his last assignment being the 1961
Buick Special. Cumberford had established a working relationship with
Frank Reisner at Intermeccanica in Italy while working on the
Griffith GT project.</p>

<p>Clark and
Cumberford, an independent designer by that time, arranged to have a
Mustang hardtop shipped to Italy in March 1965. Under Reisner&#39;s
supervision, they transformed the car over the next 11 months into
the green station wagon that graced the <i>Car
and Driver</i> cover seen here.</p>

<p>While this
vehicle shares the same basic concept as Joe Kamp&#39;s 1965 station
wagon, differences in the execution of the details are visible, most
specifically at the rear. The original car features a traditional
tailgate with a retractable rear window; the recreation features a
liftgate with a fixed rear window.</p>

<p>The <i>Car
and Driver</i> feature references a desire to
relocate the gas tank to lower the cargo floor (nothing ultimately
came of it)--as well as plans to start producing the car for
potential customers.</p>

<p>The idea
has resurfaced in the years since, with GM even considering a
Firebird station wagon at one point. Yet to this day, there has never
been a factory-built, long-roof Pony Car.</p>
