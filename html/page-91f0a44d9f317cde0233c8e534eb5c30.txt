      <p><font face="tahoma"><b>Why should you trust us with your hybrid? </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"> If I were looking for a shop to service my hybrid, 
        my biggest concern would be the mechanic's ability to maintain, diagnose, 
        and repair my hybrid competently. At Art's Automotive we've gone out of 
        our way to make sure we have the tools, training, parts, and experience 
        necessary to do the job right.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">Hybrids have been on the road for many years now, 
        and not only have we been servicing them, but we have also been jumping 
        into <a href="Art-icles.htm#Hybrid">heavy duty diagnosis and major repairs</a>, 
        the type of stuff most independents are shying away from. We won't take 
        your money for routine service, then shoo you off to the dealer as soon 
        as you have a problem. Body shop sublets and poorly repaired salvaged 
        vehicles have given us early exposure to some real &quot;head scratchers&quot;, 
        the type of diagnosis normally reserved for the top level dealership techs. 
        We've also done some major hybrid repairs, often underbidding the jobs 
        just to gain the experience. Not many independents have replaced an HV 
        transaxle or an MG2 or EPS rack on a Prius. Even fewer have rebuilt a 
        CVT, resealed an ICE, or diagnosed a bad battery control module on an 
        Insight. We have been seeking out the toughest hybrid challenges early, 
        so when we start to see problems with the &quot;normal wear &amp; tear&quot; 
        crowd, we'll be ready.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">If you bring your hybrid to us, you can rest assured 
        that it will get maintenance done correctly with the proper parts and 
        specialty fluids, not only to maintain the warranty, but also to keep 
        it running long into the future. You can also feel confident that we will 
        be able to diagnose and repair your hybrid when it breaks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"><b>Why not just take your hybrid to the dealer? Aren't 
        they experts?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">Most of the dealerships will provide very competent 
        hybrid service. However, we believe we can equal their level of expertise, 
        and charge substantially less money for the same services and repairs. 
        Our labor rate is $92 per hour, many dealerships in our area have a labor 
        rate of $150. You may need to forgo the dealer's waiting room with the 
        leather couches and big screen TV, and the handy shuttle to Bart. However, 
        with the money you save on service, you should be able to rent a car for 
        a day and still have money left over to save up for your own big screen 
        TV.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"><b>Why we originally thought we didn't want to work 
        on hybrids and what changed our mind </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">When the hybrids first came out, most of the technical 
        information we heard came from a guy who knew a guy, who supposedly knew 
        about hybrids. We heard many reasons for not buying a hybrid; stories 
        of electrocutions, $7000 battery packs that would only last a few years, 
        people stranded on the road unable to get a tow because a special hazmat 
        endorsement was required to tow a hybrid, toxic battery packs that negated 
        any benefit to the environment gained by the improved fuel economy, horrible 
        burns caused by battery acid spray after an accident. And we could also 
        imagine many reasons not to work on hybrids, chief among them, inability 
        to get information and inability to get special tools. These were the 
        reasons we originally had for wanting to avoid the hybrids. </font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">As it turns out, none of the rumors were true. All 
        of the information available to the dealers is available to the independent 
        mechanic at reasonable cost. This coupled with the number of our customers 
        who went out and bought hybrids makes us regret the fact we didn't tell 
        our customers we could be their full service hybrid shop sooner. If you 
        are one of the many customers we told we would only be doing basic hybrid 
        service in 2000, please disregard our earlier statement. We have invested 
        heavily in training, information, and tooling and we want to be your full 
        service hybrid mechanic.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"><b>Hybrid tooling vs. hybrid knowledge</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">The biggest obstacle to repairing hybrids is not 
        purchase of special tools and equipment. Most tools necessary to do most 
        hybrid repairs are already in a well equipped mechanic's tool box. Big 
        rubber insulating gloves are required for safety when disengaging the 
        battery pack and testing for power prior to repairs, but other than that, 
        there are very few hybrid specific tools that will be required on a regular 
        basis. The biggest obstacle is knowledge. It's very hard to diagnose a 
        system you don't understand. It's also easy to do damage to yourself or 
        the car with improper repair techniques. That being said, most of the 
        skills, methods, and systems in a hybrid car are already familiar to a 
        skilled mechanic. Electric motor / generator theory is well understood 
        by a good &quot;gas&quot; mechanic. Computer control is certainly nothing 
        new. Internal combustion engines are still found on the hybrids. In fact 
        most of the familiar automotive systems -- brakes, steering, suspension, 
        drivetrain, engine management, heating and air conditioning, are still 
        on the hybrid and still operate in much the same way as they do on any 
        modern car. There is a relatively small amount of training needed to make 
        a good gas car mechanic into a good hybrid mechanic. I think it's similar 
        to when a computer programmer learns a new language: he already knows 
        how to program, he just needs learn the differences in the new language. 
        Both Honda and Toyota have excellent subscription based websites with 
        all of the information we need to understand and diagnose their cars.</font></p>

      <p><font face="tahoma"><img src="Arts_Insight-005.jpg" width="450" height="233"></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">This is the car Art drives. It was the first hybrid 
        to market in the US. The Insight gets the best mileage of any of the hybrids 
        owing to it's aerodynamic body shape and very light aluminum frame. If 
        you want the insight, you'll have to be willing to trade some space for 
        the better gas mileage. The Insight is a two seater with very limited 
        trunk space, so it's not ideal for a family, but it's a very good choice 
        for singles or couples. The insight come with a 5 speed manual or a Continuously 
        Variable automatic Transmission (CVT), similar to the unit found in the 
        1996 - 2000 Civic HX.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">What can go wrong:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">We get quite a few complaints of the auto stop not 
        working, but nothing is really wrong with the car most of the time. </font><font face="tahoma"><a href="InsightAutoStop.htm">Click 
        here if your Auto Stop has stopped working</a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">We have had quite a few complaints of shuddering 
        when taking off from a stop on Insights with CVT transmissions. This is 
        usually caused by the start clutch, not because it's bad, but because 
        the transmission fluid is degraded or the wrong type. The Insight must 
        use the Genuine Honda CVT fluid. For a while, this was unavailable and 
        Honda said to use ATF-Z1, but that turned out to be a bad idea. CVT fluid 
        is now available again, and if your CVT develops a shudder, it can almost 
        always be fixed with total CVT fluid replacement. (I'd call it a flush, 
        but Honda recommends against using flushing machines :)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">We've had one CVT with a failed intermediate plate 
        bearing, which spun in the case, and loosed metal throughout the transmission, 
        destroying the differential, intermediate plate, pump two sections of 
        case, start clutch, and most of the bearings. Very bad news indeed. Honda 
        does not currently have a reman program for the Insight CVT. They also 
        do not sell a new unit. This leaves repair or used as the only options. 
        We recommend a transmission fluid drain and fill at least every 15,000 
        miles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">The electronic EGR valves fail sometimes and cause 
        surging when driving at light throttle. They're easy enough to fix, and 
        not very expensive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">The engines sometimes leak oil from the timing chain 
        tensioner O-ring, and we had one leak from the timing cover / head gasket 
        joint.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">There is a battery pack warranty extension and a 
        campaign to replace two control units to prevent premature battery pack 
        failure. These repairs are done with no charge to the owner if it applies 
        to your vehicle and the mileage is under 150K.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">Overall, the Insight has proven to be an *extremely* 
        reliable car! Too bad they stopped making them in 2006. </font></p>

      <p><font face="tahoma"><b><font size="5">The Prius 1st generation (2001-2003)</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"><img src="prius_1stgen.jpg" width="390" height="200"></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">This was the second hybrid in the US market. When 
        we saw it at the 2000 auto show, it was obvious that Toyota was rushing 
        to get it out: the show car had the steering wheel on the right side and 
        headlight and grill that had been broken and put back together with a 
        glue gun. This car is very roomy, has adequate power, gets great mileage, 
        and has brilliantly simple transmission that is only made possible on 
        a hybrid car.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">Unfortunately, we are starting to see some with wear 
        and tear mechanical failures, but most first generation Priuses will make 
        it to 100,000 miles before anything breaks, which is a whole lot better 
        than whole lot of other cars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">What can go wrong:</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">There was a recall on the battery bus bar. Toyota 
        did a very good job of getting the word out, and I've never come across 
        a first generation Prius that has not had the recall done. </font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">Some of the first generation Priuses had a recall 
        on the EPS rack (electronic power steering rack). There was also a campaign 
        on the EPS control unit. Most of these racks have already been done by 
        dealers, but we've done two here that we not covered. You do need a factory 
        scanner to do this job (or even to do an alignment) because there is a 
        zero point adjustment that must be done after steering repair or adjustment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">We have now repaired/replaced 3 out-of-warranty HV 
        transaxles. This is the part with the two motor / generators, MG1 &amp; 
        MG2. This is one of those things that works the hybrid naysayers into 
        a frenzy. &quot;See! I told you they were gonna break and be expensive 
        to repair!&quot;, they say. There is no denying that it's expensive, but 
        then again, anyone who owns a Subaru with a 2.5 DOHC motor knows that 
        sometimes really expensive stuff breaks, and the Subaru is a conventional 
        car, that gets less than 1/2 the MPG and cost the same as the Prius when 
        it was new, and is worth far less than the Prius now that they've deprecated. 
        So there!</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">Sometimes the gas motor does not start when cold 
        once the car gets to 100,000 miles or so. This causes the Master Warning 
        Indicator (the exclamation point) to come on. There is an updated ECM 
        that may correct this problem on some cars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">Sometimes the electronic throttle body gets stuck 
        and the MWI will come on. It usually will start to work again after a 
        key cycle (turn off, then turn on). I've been told by a very good Toyota 
        tech that cleaning the throttle body will not help (based on his own experience 
        with a whole lot of Priuses). Hobbit (of Prius hacking and lighting systems 
        internet fame) is convinced cleaning will cure the problem. We've seen 
        one first generation Prius with this problem so far, and we replaced the 
        throttle body.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">The gas pedal position sensors reportedly go bad 
        often. We've actually never seen a first generation Prius with this problem. 
        Were they all fixed under warranty? I don't know.</font></p>

      <p><img src="2004_2005Prius-005.jpg" width="450" height="224"></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">This in my opinion is the most best hybrid so far. 
        It doesn't beat the Insight in miles per gallon, but it has a lot more 
        room and a lot of really cool technology. Until Toyota (or whoever) comes 
        out with a diesel, all aluminum &amp; plastic, plug-in version, this generation 
        of Prius will likely continue to dominate the market. It used to be you'd 
        have trouble finding your car in a parking lot if you bought an Accord 
        or Camry. Now you are more likely to need your alarm remote to find out 
        which Prius belongs to you. (well, in Berkeley at least). So far, this 
        generation of Prius has been pretty break-down free. Most problems we've 
        seen have been due to previous accidents or errors while servicing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">What can go wrong:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">So far, this generation of Prius has been very reliable. 
        Most of them are still under 60,000 miles (as of 07/07). We've registered 
        Smart Keys, replaced tires, done alignments, and a bunch of servicing. 
        However repairs have been limited to dead 12 volt aux batteries and crash 
        related problems, such as unplugged coolant pumps, kinked thermos hoses, 
        and an leaking coolant fitting on an MG2. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">There is a recall for a software update to prevent 
        the car from shutting down if the driver foolishly presses the power button 
        while driving on the freeway. (It's actually not that hard to do while 
        reaching for the stereo). Funny, Toyota never came out and said the &quot;stalling&quot; 
        was caused by driver's pressing the power button, but I've tested this 
        theory by first pressing the power while driving, and observing the &quot;stall&quot;. 
        Then trying the same thing on the same Prius after the recall was done, 
        and observing the power would not shut off until the car was stationary. 
        Instead of saying &quot;driver error&quot; Toyota made a nebulous comment 
        about program logic to allowing a the vehicle to enter a fail safe mode. 
        They're taking the high road I guess.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">There is a recall on the lower steering shaft on 
        the 2004-2006 Prius. The 2nd generation Prius, unlike the first generation 
        Prius, has the electric assist motor on the steering column rather than 
        the rack. This means the full torque of the driver's input plus the motor 
        assist, is going through the tiny little shaft and u-joints. Over the 
        years we've had quite a few customers with non-EPS steering stubbornly 
        refuse to fix their power steering when it breaks, opting instead the 
        muscle their steering wheel when parking. This can lead to the same sort 
        of problem, a broken steering column and no steering control. If you own 
        an affected car, be sure to have this recall performed!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">When it comes time to replace your tires (about 30K 
        miles for most people) we have a better option for you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"><img src="PriusTire_0013.jpg" width="750" height="268"><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">The tires for this generation are *not* low rolling 
        resistance / high load tires. The Goodyear tires that come with the 2004-2007 
        Prius are &quot;Standard Load&quot; and have load rating of 86. We stock 
        two tires in this size that have a higher load rating , which should improve 
        fuel economy a bit. One of the tires is the Toyo Proxes TPT (400AA, 88). 
        The TPT is a good performance touring tire, but the Prius isn't a performance 
        car, so it's not the best match for the car in my opinion. We also stock 
        the MasterCraft Sensys 01 (620AB, 88). This is a long wearing tire with 
        a nice ride, and so far, I think it's the best match for the Prius. On 
        the 2007 Prius, be sure to warn your tire installer about the TPMS (tire 
        pressure monitoring system) sensor. It must be removed and pushed into 
        the tire before breaking the bead or it may be damaged. We had a customer 
        who said a dealer had charged him $700 to install &amp; register a new 
        TPMS sensor after it was broken at a tire shop. ($700 seems a bit high, 
        so there may be more to the story. We'd charge $207 in the worse case 
        scenario for one TPMS sensor).</font></p>
      <p><img src="PriusTire_0012.jpg" width="300" height="225"></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma">When the recommended air pressure of 35 PSI is used 
        for the second generation Prius with the stock tires, the tend to wear 
        on the outer edges. We recommend running 36 - 40 PSI, which will improve 
        tire life and fuel economy, but does make the ride a little rougher.</font></p>

      <p><font face="tahoma"><img src="civic_hybrid.jpg" width="450" height="208"></font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">This Civic looks just like a regular Civic, except 
        for the light weight aluminum wheels, pillar antenna, and hybrid placard 
        on the back. It's not as light or as aerodynamic as the Insight so it 
        has a larger gas motor and a more powerful electric motor to compensate 
        for the added weight and drag. However, it may not compensate enough for 
        some drivers. When compared to the Insight, the Civic is obviously less 
        zippy. The Civic weighs about 30% more than the Insight, but only has 
        14% more power to compensate, causing one of our former Honda techs to 
        dub it &quot;a slug&quot;. But hey, not everyone wants or needs zip. Some 
        just want to save some gas in a normal sized car. Because the Hybrid Civic 
        uses a larger gas motor and the resultant increased compression braking 
        interferes with the regenerative braking, Honda uses their VTEC technology 
        to close the valves on deceleration. This allows the gas motor to spin 
        freely and the electric motor / generator to slow the car and charge the 
        battery on decel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma">What can go wrong:</font></p>

        the new Civic hybrid. It could be the that the Prius did better on the

        and I've *never* seen an ad for the Civic hybrid. Either way, Honda had 
        better step it up soon if they don't want to go back to making piston

      <p><font face="Tahoma">The 2006 - 2007 Civic hybrid is able to capture more 
        energy during regen braking than the 2003-2005 Civic owing to two improvements. 
        One is the addition of a Prius style &quot;fake brake&quot;. The Civic 
        is no longer just doing regenerative deceleration (as I like to call it), 
        it's doing real regen braking, more like the Prius. The other improvement 
        to regen braking is that the VTEC system closes *all* of the valves, rather 
        than just valves for 3 cylinders like the 2003-2005. This decreases the 
        amount of braking energy absorbed by the engine and allows it to be captured 
        for charging the battery.</font></p>

      system, you're pushing a piston that is pushing fluid out of a cylinder 
      (think bicycle pump), through brake lines, to a hydraulic caliper that squeezes 
      stationary brake pads against a rotor that spins along with the wheel. When 
      you step on the brake in a Prius, your still pushing fluid with a piston, 
      but instead of going to the calipers, the fluid goes to a &quot;dead end&quot; 
      chamber with a piston that pushes on one or two springs. The only purpose 
      of the chamber is to provide a pedal feel for the driver. When the brake 
      is pressed with moderate pressure, the piston is only touches the softer 
      of the 2 springs, providing a little give in the brake pedal. This simulates 
      line and caliper flex normally felt on a conventional system. When brake 
      pedal is pressed harder, the piston comes in contact with the second, stiffer, 
      spring, providing a harder brake pedal, simulating the feel of a conventional 
      brake system once the &quot;slack&quot; has been removed. The real braking 
      work is controlled by a brake control computer, which monitors the brake 
      pedal position with two redundant sensors. The brake computer then uses 
      the electric motor / generator MG2 to slow the car and charge the battery 
      or applies pressure to the calipers using pressure stored in the ABS accumulator. 
      If there were a serious brake control problem, two solenoids open, by-passing

        of one sun gear, one ring gear, 4 planetary gears mounted to a carrier 
        and a couple shaft bearings. That sentence accounts for all the moving 
        parts if you don't count the integral differential and drive chain. Mentioning

        hydraulic pressure. The hydraulic pressure is directed to push the steering 
        rack gear to the left or the right depending on which way you turn the 
        wheel. There are two problems with this system. 1) the pump is putting 
        a load on the engine whenever the engine is running and burning up gas 
        whether you need help steering at that moment or not. And 2) the pump 
        is not spinning when the engine is not spinning, which is a problem for 
        hybrid vehicles, since the engine shuts off at idle. EPS (electronic power

        electric motor/generator (AKA &quot;MG&quot;) to charge the battery pack. 
        Honda, unlike Toyota, has the MG bolted directly to the crankshaft, so 
        any time the gas engine is spinning, the MG is is also spinning and vice 
        versa. This creates a problem when trying recapture energy on deceleration. 
        What Honda wants to do is spin the MG with the wheels as the car is slowing,

        and charging does not begin until 40% of full charge. The hybrid's computer

      <p><font face="tahoma">Batteries can be rated by their energy to weight 
        ratio, which is a very important metric if you are hauling your battery 
        around with you. This type of rating is expressed as watt-hours per kilogram 
        (Wh/kg). The higher the number in the Wh/kg rating, the more power the 
        battery has per pound. Lead acid batteries (like the one you will find

        (the older style rechargeables that turned a lot of people off to rechargeable

        have double the Wh/kg rating of NiMH at 140 Wh/kg, and are found in some 
        full electric vehicles. I don't know why they aren't used in hybrids, 
        perhaps the occasional news item about exploding laptops or cell phones 
        has something to do with it, maybe they just don't last long enough, or 
        maybe they are hard to recycle or dispose of. If you know, drop me a line; 
        I'm curious.<br>
        <br>
        NiMH batteries can be recycled, much like the lead acid batteries are 
        now, so they do not pose the disposal danger that some have claimed. In 
        fact, the regular single use Alkaline batteries that everyone seems to 
        be buying in bulk and throwing in the landfill pose a greater environmental

      suitable replacement can be easily fabricated. The tool pictured to the 
      right took so long to arrive, our tech Sandor had built and used his home 
      made tool, and the car had already been delivered to the customer, by the 
      time it finally arrived. If you are crafty, you can save your money. </font></td>

    <td width="408" height="275" valign="middle"><font face="Tahoma">This is another 
      CVT tool. There is an embarrassing story surrounding this puller, which 
      I'm not going to tell. I'd rather leave the world in the dark about the 
      dumb stuff I can do. Anyway, most pullers in commercial puller sets do not 
      have long enough feet to grab the CVT start clutch in the appropriate spot. 
      You can easily fabricate new legs to use with a Snap-On two jaw puller if 
      you want to save some money. The puller on the right can be purchased from 
      Honda.</font></td>

        tester used by Honda, just with the Interstate brand on it. Internal resistance 
        testers like this one are ideal for testing the glass mat auxiliary batteries 
        found in the Prius. Interstate batteries was kind enough to supply us 
        with this tester for free as a reward for the volume of Interstate batteries 
        we sell. There are a few other testers that will work for glass mat batteries: 
        the Snap On &quot;MicroVat&quot; and the Bear ARBST (also available rebranded

      <p><font face="tahoma">There are an amazing number of excellent hybrid websites. 
        When researching specs and such, I found lots of sites that had so much 
        more information than I was willing (or able in many cases) to write. 
        Many appear to have been created solely as an outlet for smart people 
        bursting at the seams with information about their new passion -- hybrids! 
        Rather than attempt to rewrite what has already well explained on other 
        sites, I decided to keep our page short and provide links to some of the 
        most impressive sites. </font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"><a href="http://prius.ecrostech.com/">http://prius.ecrostech.com/</a><br>
        This is my favorite hybrid web site so far. It's written by a very smart 
        guy who owns a 1st generation Prius and has enough time to do some great 
        research and testing to better understand how it works. If you are bored 
        by the information on Toyota's web site, and think the Toyota workshop 
        manual doesn't go into enough detail, this is the site for you.</font></p>

        <font face="tahoma">I love this site! There is a lot of information and 
        a bunch of links just in case you're able to read all there is before 
        Hobbit adds more. All sorts of exploratory hacks, including disassembling 
        a body ECU, not sure why yet, but it sure looks fun.</font></p>
      <p><a name="#hybridcars"></a><a href="http://www.hybridcars.com"><font face="tahoma">http://www.hybridcars.com</font></a><br>
        <font face="tahoma">You'll find a lot of hybrid &amp; green minded stuff 
        at hybridcars.com -- information for potential and current hybrid owners, 
        hybrid model reviews &amp; specs, discussion forums, environmental articles 
        and news, technology explanations, and more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="tahoma"><a href="http://www.greenhybrid.com/compare/mileage/">http://www.greenhybrid.com/compare/mileage/</a><br>
        This site has a database stocked with mileage measurements from hybrid 
        owners. You can register and contribute your own mileage measurements 
        as well.</font></p>

        This has all of the basic information about hybrids. You'll have to ignore 
        the flashing banners and such, but it's a small price to pay for free 
        info.</font></p>

        This is an interesting site. It's an online magazine with some of the 
        same features as our site. Anyway, I thought their hybrid article was 
        pretty good. You can click on the home button to see the rest of their 
        site.</font></p>
