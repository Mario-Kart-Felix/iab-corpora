</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">The most common question among motorcycle owners when 
discussing the upkeep of their &quot;baby&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">seems to be what motor oil they should use. Of course, from 
this central question other important and </p>
<p align="justify">related ones arise. What viscosity should you use? How long 
should they leave your oil in? What filter</p>
<p align="justify">should you use? Etc.</p>
<p align="justify">Unfortunately, there is a great deal of misinformation 
circulating throughout the motorcycle community -</p>
<p align="justify">much of it propagated by motorcycle manufacturers and dealers 
in order to increase their bottom line.</p>
<p align="justify">And guess who's being bled dry? YOU!</p>
<p align="justify">In this article, I hope to dispel some of the myths that are 
so prevalent among motorcycle owners and</p>
<p align="justify">shed some light on the REAL issues that must be considered 
when choosing a motor oil for your pride</p>
<p align="justify">and joy. Although some of what I say in this article will 
apply to other motorcycle applications, most of it</p>
<p align="justify">will focus on wet-clutch applications - since these are where 
most of the confusion lies.</p>
<p align="justify">One question that invariably arises when deciding on which 
oil to use in your motorcycle is whether to</p>
<p align="justify">use synthetic oil or petroleum oil. Although the answer lies 
in what your expectations are for your</p>
<p align="justify">motorcycle, here are a few issues you should consider when 
making your choice:</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial,Bold" SIZE="4" color="#0000FF"><u><b>
<p align="justify">HIGH TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE</p>
</b></u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">I believe this is generally a well known fact, but synthetic 
oils will, in general, perform much better in</p>
<p align="justify">high temperature applications than petroleum oils will. There 
are a number of reasons for this that I</p>
<p align="justify">could spend a few pages on. However, without going into a 
great deal of detail, here's the Reader's</p>
<p align="justify">Digest Version.</p>
<p align="justify">The synthetic basestocks that synthetic oils are manufactured 
from have much higher flash points than</p>
<p align="justify">petroleum oils typically do. In layman's terms, the flash 
point of an oil is the point at which it begins to</p>
<p align="justify">vaporize. The higher this flash point, the better the oil 
will hold up in high temperature environments.</p>
<p align="justify">In addition, because synthetic oils are made up of particles 
of uniform size, they have less &quot;internal</p>
<p align="justify">friction&quot; than petroleum oils (which are made up of particles 
varying greatly in size). This lowers the</p>
<p align="justify">temperature of the oil, thus improving the cooling qualities 
of the oil. Of course, the end result is cooler</p>
<p align="justify">engine temperatures.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondarily, synthetic oils do not cause the &quot;blanket effect&quot; 
that petroleum oils do. Because petroleum</p>
<p align="justify">oils are made up of particles of varying sizes, the smaller 
particles tend to flow freely through the center</p>
<p align="justify">of the oil galleries within your engine while the larger 
sized particles will be pushed to the &quot;outside&quot; of</p>
<p align="justify">the oil stream - next to engine components. These large 
particles, for the most part, remain there and</p>
<p align="justify">do not distribute heat from engine components back to the 
oil.</p>
<p align="justify">The uniform particles within a synthetic oil will </font>
<font FACE="Arial,Bold" SIZE="3"><b>all </b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
flow just as easily through oil galleries. Larger</p>
<p align="justify">particles are not present to &quot;blanket&quot; engine component 
surfaces. Therefore, heat is distributed into the</p>
<p align="justify">oil and carried away.</p>
<p align="justify">The end result is that a good quality synthetic oil can lower 
engine temperatures by as much as 20 to</p>
<p align="justify">50 degrees F. That can significantly extend the life of 
critical engine components. In addition, less</p>
<p align="justify">stress is put on the oil, which extends its useful life as 
well.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000FF"><b>
<p align="justify"><u>SYNTHETIC VS. PETROLEUM OIL</u></p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">Of course, the harder you run your bike, the more important 
these issues will be. Leisure riders will not</p>
<p align="justify">have as much problem with this issue, but the issue does 
still exist.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial,Bold" SIZE="4" color="#0000FF"><u><b>
<p align="justify">SLUDGE AND DEPOSIT FORMATION</p>
</b></u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">Petroleum oils are very prone to leaving behind sludge, 
varnish and other deposits while synthetics are</p>
<p align="justify">not. You see, petroleum basestocks contain many impurities 
right from the factory. This is because they</p>
<p align="justify">are a refined product. The refining process is designed to 
take out impurities. However, no refining</p>
<p align="justify">process is 100%, and to achieve a level even close to that 
for a petroleum oil is a very expensive</p>
<p align="justify">process.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, to keep petroleum oil prices down, motor oil 
manufacturers have to find a &quot;happy medium&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">between high cost and high impurity levels. The end result is 
a &quot;fairly clean&quot; petroleum basestock.</p>
<p align="justify">However, a number of impurities still are present.</p>
<p align="justify">Synthetic oils do not have this problem with impurities. The 
only thing in a synthetic oil is what the</p>
<p align="justify">chemists put into the oil blend - and they don't add anything 
unless it improves the quality of engine</p>
<p align="justify">protection and performance offered by the oil.</p>
<p align="justify">As motor oil burns off, any impurities within the oil are 
left behind to cling to engine component</p>
<p align="justify">surfaces. Since petroleum oils are more prone to high 
temperature degradation than synthetic oils are</p>
<p align="justify">AND contain higher levels of contamination in the first 
place, they leave behind much higher levels of</p>
<p align="justify">engine deposits.</p>
<p align="justify">This is especially true within an air cooled engine which 
runs at higher temperatures than a water</p>
<p align="justify">cooled engine because a petroleum oil is more apt to burn off 
under these temperature extremes. As a</p>
<p align="justify">result, expect higher levels of deposit formation within a 
motorcycle application than with an automotive</p>
<p align="justify">application if using a petroleum oil.</p>
<p align="justify">Obviously, the effect of having higher levels of deposit 
formation within your engine is seen in multiple</p>
<p align="justify">areas. First, performance will obviously be decreased. Top 
end speeds will decline. Your bike won't get</p>
<p align="justify">the same &quot;jump&quot; out of the starting blocks that it once did. 
I think you get the picture.</p>
<p align="justify">A second and related area of concern is fuel mileage. If you 
gum up the works, your mileage will</p>
<p align="justify">decrease - without a doubt. Of course, this mileage decrease 
occurs over time, so it is less noticeable.</p>
<p align="justify">Most people seem to expect a mileage drop over time as just a 
fact of life. However, it doesn't have to</p>
<p align="justify">be that way. Synthetic oils will offer you better fuel 
mileage to begin with AND will maintain that high</p>
<p align="justify">level of fuel efficiency much longer than a petroleum oil 
will.</p>
<p align="justify">A third area of concern, if your bike is a wet-clutch 
application, should be your clutch faces. Any deposit</p>
<p align="justify">formation on these faces from your motor oil will likely 
cause clutch slippage to some extent. The more</p>
<p align="justify">deposit formation, the more slippage that will occur. So, 
since synthetic oils leave fewer deposits than</p>
<p align="justify">petroleum oils, they are the superior choice if you wish to 
avoid potential clutch slippage.</p>
<p align="justify">Now you might say, &quot;How would I know if I were experiencing 
clutch slippage anyway?&quot;. Well, to be</p>
<p align="justify">honest, it's not always easy. If you were experiencing clutch 
slippage, it is likely that your top end speed</p>
<p align="justify">would be up to 10 to 20 mph slower than if you were not 
having any slippage.</p>
<p align="justify">However, the only way to know for certain if you've got 
clutch slippage due to deposit formation would</p>
<p align="justify">be to check your top end speed. Then, have your bike in to be 
serviced, and have them check your</p>
<p align="justify">clutch faces. If there is no deposit formation, then you know 
you're not experiencing clutch slippage due</p>
<p align="justify">to deposit formation. However, you MIGHT be experiencing 
clutch slippage due to another issue that</p>
<p align="justify">we'll get to in a little while.</p>
<p align="justify">If there ARE deposits on your clutch faces, have the issue 
taken care of. Then, check your top end</p>
<p align="justify">speed again (using the same oil). If your top end speed has 
increased significantly, then you know that</p>
<p align="justify">the deposits were likely the problem. At that point I'd be 
draining the oil and replacing it with a good</p>
<p align="justify">synthetic that won't leave those deposits.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial,Bold" SIZE="4" color="#0000FF"><u><b>
<p align="justify">LONGER OIL LIFE</p>
</b></u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">As much as this issue is debated, most people agree that 
synthetics hold up better than petroleum oils.</p>
<p align="justify">In fact, many people even believe that synthetic oils will 
probably last longer than petroleum oils &quot;in</p>
<p align="justify">theory&quot;. However, in practice, very few people actually put 
this theory to the test.</p>
<p align="justify">They worry about ruining their engines. They are concerned 
that even if the oil is in good shape it may</p>
<p align="justify">be carrying too much debris to adequately protect your 
engine. The fact is that these worries are really</p>
<p align="justify">unfounded. There is plenty of evidence to indicate that just 
about any synthetic oil will outlast a</p>
<p align="justify">petroleum oil by about 2 to 3 times.</p>
<p align="justify">You might want to continue to change your filter at the old 3 
to 5,000 mile interval (unless you're using</p>
<p align="justify">a high efficiency filter designed for extended change 
intervals), but the oil will still be good for continued</p>
<p align="justify">use long after 5,000 miles. Most any synthetic oil will be 
good for at least 7500 miles, even in an aircooled motorcycle application. Some 
synthetics will even be good for 10 to 15,000 miles or more.</p>
<p align="justify">In the end, using extended oil drain intervals could save you 
a great deal of money without sacrificing</p>
<p align="justify">engine protection. Of course, you have to do what you're 
comfortable with, but the facts are in.</p>
<p align="justify">Synthetics WILL last longer than petroleum oils, no matter 
what kind of filtration you're using.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial,Bold" SIZE="4" color="#0000FF"><u><b>
<p align="justify">BEARING SLIPPAGE</p>
</b></u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">Talk to many motorcycle manufacturers/dealers (especially 
HD), and you'll find that they might tell you</p>
<p align="justify">to avoid synthetics in your bike. That trend is slowly 
changing, but I wouldn't be surprised if you run</p>
<p align="justify">across someone who tries to tell you that synthetics will 
ruin your bike.</p>
<p align="justify">Most of them refer to bearing slippage. They say that 
synthetic oils are &quot;too slippery&quot; to maintain</p>
<p align="justify">enough friction for bearings to roll as they are supposed to. 
As a result, the say that using synthetic oil</p>
<p align="justify">will cause your bearings to &quot;slip&quot; instead. Of course, if 
that were to happen, flat spots would occur on</p>
<p align="justify">bearings.</p>
<p align="justify">That is a bunch of nonsense. Of all the motorcycle mechanics 
I've ever spoken with, I've never had one</p>
<p align="justify">of them say that they've seen any flat spots on bearings in 
bikes that used synthetic oil. It just doesn't</p>
<p align="justify">happen.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial,Bold" size="4" color="#0000FF"><u><b>
<p align="justify">TYING IT ALL TOGETHER</p>
</b></u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">Basically, the story on synthetic vs. petroleum oil for 
motorcycles comes down to this. If you're not</p>
<p align="justify">going to own your bike for more than a few years and you 
don't expect to ride it hard, petroleum will</p>
<p align="justify">work just fine. However, if you intend on keeping your bike 
for the long haul and want to maintain its</p>
<p align="justify">performance characteristics for more than a couple of years, 
there is no question that you should be</p>
<p align="justify">going with synthetic.</p>
<p align="justify">And, if you intend on running your bike hard, only a quality 
synthetic can guarantee you proper</p>
<p align="justify">protection and performance. Petroleum oils simply don't cut 
it in these types of situations.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000FF"><b>
<p align="justify">AUTOMOTIVE OIL VS. MOTORCYCLE OIL</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">Now that we've covered the question of whether you should be 
using synthetic or petroleum oil, we</p>
<p align="justify">come to the issue of whether to use a motorcycle specific oil 
or not. You'll hear varying opinions on this.</p>
<p align="justify">I'm going to lay out the facts for you, and you can decide 
what to do with them.</p>
<p align="justify">Speak with just about any motorcycle manufacturer rep or 
dealer and you'll hear the following rhetoric:</p>
<p align="justify">Don't use any oil that has an API rating higher than SG. Some 
will even go so far as to say no higher</p>
<p align="justify">than SF.</p>
<p align="justify">In case you don't know what those letters mean, the American 
Petroleum Institute (API) comes out with</p>
<p align="justify">new standards for motor oils every few years. Each time they 
come out with a new standard, the bar is</p>
<p align="justify">raised. Fuel efficiency must be better, protection benefits 
must be increased, cold temperature</p>
<p align="justify">performance must be improved, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">So, the higher the second letter of the &quot;code&quot; the &quot;better&quot; 
the oil. In other words, you should expect an</p>
<p align="justify">SH oil to be better than an SG oil, and an SJ oil is better 
than an SH oil, etc. As a side note, gasoline</p>
<p align="justify">oils are always rated as an Sx, with the &quot;x&quot; being the level 
of the rating. Diesel oils are always rated</p>
<p align="justify">with a Cx. Sometimes there will even be a number after the Cx, 
such as with a diesel CG-4 or CH-4</p>
<p align="justify">specification. Again, the higher the second letter, the 
better the oil. An oil that meets both the API</p>
<p align="justify">gasoline specs and the diesel specs will likely carry both 
API ratings.</p>
<p align="justify">Motorcycle manufacturers have come up with a very clever way 
to avoid meeting the newer and more</p>
<p align="justify">stringent API standards while still selling their oils as 
premium &quot;motorcycle-specific&quot; lubricants. Most</p>
<p align="justify">motorcycle-specific oils haven't been tested for the latest 
API standards in the past decade or so. They</p>
<p align="justify">are still rated SF or SG, which, according to motorcycle 
manufacturers and dealers is better for your</p>
<p align="justify">bike. Many times they'll even go so far as to say that 
they'll void your warranty if you use an oil that is</p>
<p align="justify">SH or SJ rated.</p>
<p align="justify">That makes it easy to scare you into thinking you need their 
oil because you don't feel like you have</p>
<p align="justify">much choice. As a result, motorcycle manufacturers have been 
able to charge many motorcyclists</p>
<p align="justify">$3.00 to $5.00 per quart or more for old, outdated petroleum 
motor oil formulations that would sell for</p>
<p align="justify">about 50 cents in an auto parts store.</p>
<p align="justify">Do you think they're making a killing on these products? Do 
you think they're going to shoot straight</p>
<p align="justify">with you if they can keep raking in the loot? I think we know 
the answer to those questions.</p>
<p align="justify">Just to set the record straight, they can't legally void your 
warranty for using an SH or SJ rated oil</p>
<p align="justify">unless they can prove that use of such oils actually caused 
the mechanical failure in question. That's</p>
<p align="justify">not to say they might not try, but if you stick to your guns, 
they really don't have a leg to stand on. They</p>
<p align="justify">don't have any way of knowing that you used such oils anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">If you want to see the legislation that outlines these 
warranty coverage issues, head on over to Chapter</p>
<p align="justify">13 and read the section titled &quot;New Car Warranties and 
Extended Drains&quot;. Or, simply </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000ff">
click here</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">.</p>
<p align="justify">The truth is that many automotive oils are actually better 
for your bike than some motorcycle-specific</p>
<p align="justify">oils. Let's take a look at some of the flaws in their 
arguments and see if we can't wade through the</p>
<p align="justify">mumbo-jumbo.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial,Bold" SIZE="4" color="#0000FF"><u><b>
<p align="justify">ZINC AND PHOSPHORUS LEVELS</p>
</b></u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">One of the reasons that motorcycle manufacturers and dealers 
say that you shouldn't use an SH or SJ</p>
<p align="justify">rated oil is because these oils supposedly have less zinc and 
phosphorus than SF and SG oils. This is</p>
<p align="justify">really only half true. But first, let's talk about the 
purpose of zinc and phosphorus in your oil to begin</p>
<p align="justify">with.</p>
<p align="justify">Zinc and phosphorus are actually almost always added to an 
oil in combination and in closely related</p>
<p align="justify">amounts. They work as a tag team to help minimize wear due to 
metal-to-metal contact. In essence, if</p>
<p align="justify">there is ever a time when your engine components are under 
significant stress and the oil can't</p>
<p align="justify">maintain a film of lubricity between metal components, metal 
to metal contact will occur.</p>
<p align="justify">Under these conditions, without some extra measure of 
protection, this would cause severe wear within</p>
<p align="justify">your engine. However, the addition of zinc and phosphorus to 
your oil minimizes this risk. The zinc and</p>
<p align="justify">phosphorus will actually form a thin &quot;plating&quot; over engine 
components preventing actual metal to metal</p>
<p align="justify">contact - thereby preventing metal to metal wear. This is a 
VERY good thing, and very desirable.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep in mind a couple of things, though. First of all, the 
amount of zinc and phosphorus in your oil does</p>
<p align="justify">not determine &quot;how well&quot; your engine will be protected 
against metal to metal contact. More zinc and</p>
<p align="justify">phosphorus does not mean better protection. However, it does 
mean &quot;longer&quot; protection. The more zinc</p>
<p align="justify">and phosphorus you have in your motor oil, the more times it 
will be able to prevent engine wear from</p>
<p align="justify">metal to metal contact.</p>
<p align="justify">With that said, let's move on to the fallacy of the argument 
against SH and SJ oils for motorcycle use.</p>
<p align="justify">First, it must be understood that most motorcycle 
applications call for a 10W-40 or 20W-50 viscosity</p>
<p align="justify">grade, especially for larger engines and V- twin 
applications. So, in determining whether you can safely</p>
<p align="justify">use an automotive oil in your motorcycle engine, only those 
two grades really need to be considered (or</p>
<p align="justify">some similar grade like 20W-40 or 15W-50).</p>
<p align="justify">So, here's the deal. API SH and SJ specifications have indeed 
lowered the maximum acceptable limits</p>
<p align="justify">for zinc and phosphorus content of an oil. However, two 
things are important to note here. First of all,</p>
<p align="justify">anything over a 30 weight oil (ie. anything other than a 
0W-30, 5W-30 or 10W-30) is NOT required to</p>
<p align="justify">meet the zinc and phosphorus limit imposed by the SJ 
specification. In other words, a 10W-40 or 20W-</p>
<p align="justify">50 motor oil can be rated SJ without being limited to the 
lower zinc and phosphorus levels.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, many oils in this viscosity range contain as much 
zinc and phosphorus as they did before</p>
<p align="justify">meeting the API SJ specifications. Moreover, it is 
interesting to note that many of the motorcyclespecific</p>
<p align="justify">SF and SG rated oils on the market have zinc and phosphorus 
levels that are UNDER the limits</p>
<p align="justify">set by the API SJ specs AND under the levels of many standard 
automotive oils.</p>
<p align="justify">In other words, there is no reason that they could not have 
been formulated for SJ consideration</p>
<p align="justify">without changing their zinc and phosphorus levels at all 
(although, as I said, they wouldn't be required</p>
<p align="justify">to meet those requirements anyway). This makes it pretty 
clear that their only motivation for not</p>
<p align="justify">meeting SJ specifications is to save money on reformulation 
and relabeling.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial,Bold" SIZE="4" color="#0000FF"><u><b>
<p align="justify">FRICTION MODIFIERS</p>
</b></u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">Motorcycle manufacturers and dealers also refer to &quot;friction 
modifiers&quot; as being another reason not to</p>
<p align="justify">use API SJ rated automotive oils. This MIGHT be the only 
somewhat valid point they make. However, it</p>
<p align="justify">is not justified in all cases. Let me explain the issue more 
fully.</p>
<p align="justify">API SJ specifications mandate increased fuel economy over 
previous API ratings. In order to meet this</p>
<p align="justify">qualification, motor oil manufacturers must add friction 
modifiers to their motor oil formulations. It is</p>
<p align="justify">believed that these friction modifiers MAY cause clutch 
slippage, although I have not seen any specific</p>
<p align="justify">scientific testing to validate this claim.</p>
<p align="justify">I have spoken with some motorcycle owners who switched from 
an automotive oil which may have</p>
<p align="justify">contained friction modifiers to a synthetic motorcycle 
specific motor oil and noticed a significant</p>
<p align="justify">increase in top end speeds (10 to 20 mph) immediately. This 
could be an indication that there was</p>
<p align="justify">clutch slippage occurring before the switch. However, it is 
also possible that this increase is due to</p>
<p align="justify">simply switching to a better formulation of oil which 
provides better performance. I have no way to say</p>
<p align="justify">one way or the other.</p>
<p align="justify">What is important to note is this: Just as 10W-40 and 20W-50 
weight oils are exempt from the</p>
<p align="justify">zinc/phosphorus limits put in place by API SJ specifications, 
these same grade oils are exempt from the</p>
<p align="justify">fuel efficiency mandates that the SJ rating requires. Thus, 
it is not necessary for motor oil</p>
<p align="justify">manufacturers to add friction modifiers to their 40 and 50 
weight motor oils.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, it cannot be assumed that just because an oil 
meets API SJ specs it must contain friction</p>
<p align="justify">modifiers. It doesn't have to. Some automotive 10W-40 and 
20W-50 motor oils may contain no friction</p>
<p align="justify">modifiers whatsoever. This could only be determined by 
speaking with the manufacturer themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">Unfortunately, if that manufacturer also carries a motorcycle 
specific brand of oil, it is likely that they</p>
<p align="justify">would point you that direction and avoid answering the 
question. This is because their motorcycle</p>
<p align="justify">specific oil generally costs more and makes them a better 
profit.</p>
<p align="justify">So, in the real world, here's where you stand. Just because a 
10W-40 or 20W-50 automotive oil meets</p>
<p align="justify">SJ specs, that doesn't mean that it contains friction 
modifiers, although it might. There is no scientific</p>
<p align="justify">evidence that indicates that friction modifiers cause clutch 
slippage, although some anecdotal evidence</p>
<p align="justify">suggests that it is possible.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, if you want to take the risk, you could use any 
automotive oil you wish (although preferably</p>
<p align="justify">synthetic) and take your chances in regards to clutch 
slippage. If slippage does occur, you'll likely need</p>
<p align="justify">repairs sooner than if no slippage occurred. If you don't 
want to take the risk, but don't mind making</p>
<p align="justify">some phone calls, you might be able to find an automotive oil 
which you can be certain does not</p>
<p align="justify">contain friction modifiers. This might take some digging 
though.</p>
<p align="justify">If, on the other hand, you don't want to waste your time on 
all that research but don't want to risk clutch</p>
<p align="justify">slippage, find a good motorcycle specific oil that won't cost 
you an arm and a leg and stick with it.</p>
<p align="justify">However, look for motorcycle specific oil that is still SJ 
rated. This assures you that you've got the latest</p>
<p align="justify">in motor oil technology but designed for wet-clutch 
compatibility.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a wide range in pricing for motorcycle specific 
oils. Petroleum based products can range in the</p>
<p align="justify">$2.00 to $5.00 or more depending on who you purchase from. 
Keep in mind they are still petroleum oil -</p>
<p align="justify">nothing all that special, but at least you'll be sure there 
are no friction modifiers. Synthetic based</p>
<p align="justify">motorcycle specific oils range from about $6.00 up to $12 per 
quart.</p>
<p align="justify">Believe it or not, the best of the pack is the least 
expensive of any of them and offers extended drain</p>
<p align="justify">intervals to boot.</p>
<p align="justify">Now that you've hopefully established what type of oil you 
are planning on using - or at least have</p>
<p align="justify">established criteria for making the final decision - there is 
still the question of what viscosity grade to</p>
<p align="justify">use. Many owner's manuals will recommend both a 10W-40 and 
20W-50 for your bike. So which one</p>
<p align="justify">do you choose, and why?</p>
<p align="justify">For what it's worth, this is what I recommend. If you are 
going to stick with a petroleum oil, I highly</p>
<p align="justify">recommend going with the 20W-50, especially in a V-Twin 
engine. In MOST cases, if you have the</p>
<p align="justify">choice between a 10W-40 and 20W-50 of the same brand of oil - 
both designed for the same type</p>
<p align="justify">application - the 20W-50 will offer better engine protection.</p>
<p align="justify">However, if the issue of lifter &quot;bleed down/pump up&quot; is one 
you'd like to avoid, the 10W-40 will generally</p>
<p align="justify">allow the lifters to pump back up more quickly. This can 
reduce the &quot;ticking&quot; that you hear at engine</p>
<p align="justify">start-up.</p>

<p align="justify"><u>WHAT VISCOSITY SHOULD YOU USE?</u></p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p align="justify">If you decide to stick with a synthetic oil, then it's 
probably much less important which grade you use</p>
<p align="justify">(10W-40 or 20W-50). Both will likely provide plenty of 
protection for your engine - even a V-Twin</p>
<p align="justify">engine. You'll still see your lifters pump back up much more 
quickly with a 10W-40 than a 20W-50.</p>
<p align="justify">As far as temperatures go, once you get into a good quality 
synthetic, high temperature issues are</p>
<p align="justify">much less important when selecting a viscosity grade. They 
actually become more important when</p>
<p align="justify">selecting the brand of oil that you use. Some brands of 
synthetic are somewhat low quality and have</p>
<p align="justify">flash points only slightly higher than petroleum oils of the 
same grade.</p>
<p align="justify">If you plan on doing any cold weather riding, the 10W-40 will 
be the better choice in just about all</p>
<p align="justify">circumstances. As I said, if comparing oils within the same 
brand, if the 20W-50 is a good quality oil</p>
<p align="justify">with good flash points, the 10W-40 will likely be also. 
Therefore, you can somewhat forget about the</p>
<p align="justify">high temperature issue and focus on what will be better for 
cold temperature operation.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a question that will probably be debated for some 
years to come. The old adage of &quot;3,000 mile</p>
<p align="justify">oil changes&quot; is so prevalent that many people don't even 
consider the possibility of extended drains.</p>
<p align="justify">The most common reasonings for NOT extending oil drains are 
&quot;too much oil contamination&quot;, &quot;high</p>
<p align="justify">temperature degradation&quot; or &quot;additive depletion&quot;. Although 
these issues are important to consider, they</p>
<p align="justify">apply differently to different oil types.</p>
<p align="justify">The fact is, that with a petroleum oil and standard filter, 
you are probably well served to continue 3,000</p>
<p align="justify">mile oil changes. If you're using a premium high efficiency 
oil filter with standard petroleum oil, you</p>
<p align="justify">might extend to 4,000 or 5,000 miles. If you step up to just 
about any synthetic on the market, you can</p>
<p align="justify">probably extend oil drains to 6,000 miles or so even with a 
standard filter. Use synthetic AND a high</p>
<p align="justify">efficiency oil filter, and you're probably ok for about 7,500 
to 9,000 miles.</p>
<p align="justify">Believe it or not, you can extend oil drains even further 
than that with the right oil and filter. The oil</p>
<p align="justify">should be synthetic and it must be properly additized for 
extended drain use. There aren't many oils on</p>
<p align="justify">the market that are formulated for such use, and those that 
are, generally are VERY expensive and/or</p>
<p align="justify">not designed for motorcycle use (especially wet-clutch).</p>
<p align="justify">However, there is at least one oil on the market that is very 
reasonably priced and designed for such</p>
<p align="justify">extended drain use. Amsoil manufacturers a motorcycle 
specific oil in a 10w40 and 20w50 grade as</p>
<p align="justify">mentioned a little earlier in this article. These oils cost 
about $6.00 per quart. If you are using a</p>
<p align="justify">standard oil filter, then you should be able to get about 
10,000 miles out of Amsoil motorcycle oils</p>
<p align="justify">without any trouble in touring bikes. Really high revving, 
high performance racing bikes and such, might</p>
<p align="justify">consider slightly shorter intervals.</p>
<p align="justify">Neo motorcycle oils may also be ok for extended drains. They 
have a 10w40 and a 20w50 which</p>
<p align="justify">appear to be wet-clutch compatible. Neo's other oils are 
designed for extended drain use. I'm guessing</p>
<p align="justify">that their motorcycle oils would be also although I haven't 
been able to confirm this from their website</p>
<p align="justify">information. The cost is about $10 per quart, which is still 
very reasonable for a synthetic, extended</p>
<p align="justify">drain motorcycle oil.</p>
<p align="justify">There may very well be other motorcycle oils available for 
extended drain use as well. A little extra</p>
<p align="justify">research would tell you for sure. Just do an Internet search 
for &quot;synthetic motorcycle oil&quot; and then</p>
<p align="justify">check for extended drain capability.</p>
<p align="justify">If you choose to use a high efficiency oil filter (there are 
number of brands out there including an Mobile</p>
<p align="justify">1, Pure 1, AC Delco and an Amsoil brand oil filter, as well 
as others), you could very likely extend your</p>
<p align="justify">oil drains even further because your oil would remain much 
cleaner than with a conventional filter.</p>
