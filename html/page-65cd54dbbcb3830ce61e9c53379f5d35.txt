Thomas did a full service on my 1995 SLl500 including transmission flush, oil change, all filters, new rotors and caps and plugs. His price was better than everybody else.

        <p>Greg, we are sorry for the confusion and want to let you know that we will take this feedback back to our team. An oil change is different from an actual A Service for your Benz. An Oil change is part of a factory service but there are other things included as well. Please let us know if we can be of service to bring you back to our facility.</p>      </div>
