    <B>REVIEW</B> :Hi! <BR>
     I have purchased Wagon R Lxi Petrol in Nov'2007. It is my first car. Ever since, i have purchased this car, i have not spent more than Rs.7000/- per annum on an avg. Car is good. I like the sitting posture while driving this car. Less driving fatigue. Better visibility on the road due to the height. I find it comfortable, spacious carries good amount of lugguage. I have never ever driven this car without A/C. I get 13.5 kmpl in city and 15kmpl on highways. Longest distance travelled with this car is around 3300Kms. from Pune-Hyd-Tirupati-Pondicherry-Vellore-Bangalore-Mysore-Pune. I had no trouble. Fill petrol and drive it...On the longest stretch driven in one go was Mysore to Pune. i got around 19 kmpl.
In short, i would say it is a very good car.<BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> :I purchased WagonR in Sept. 2008. It is a good car, both economical and stylish.  Pick up no issue, is very good.  Gear shifting a problem here and there, especially reverse. The car gives upto 15 Kms withour AC in Pune. I would like to have more informaion on the maintenance aspect as this will improve the performance of the car in the long run.  I service the car once in a year.  Is there need to increase the frequency of servicing as time goes.<BR>

    2002 Model. It has limitations, like the rear shockers and Clutch wire...&amp;
    Plate...are not up to the mark.<BR>
     <BR>
     With new technology Maruti shud improve the Clutch, rear shockers and the
    Gear Box system.<BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : I purchased a wagonR LPG fitted car-maruthi from Indus
    Motors Muvattupuzha-Kerala.<BR>
     <BR>
     Performance of the car is very very poor. Frequently breaking the air
    filter cover and mileage getting 8kms/ litter really I am fed up with this
    car. Now I remember that, how the best performance was my old maruthi 800. <BR>
     <BR>
     Since two years completed still the service engineers cant find the
    problems and rectified.<BR>
     <BR>
     I am thinking about to change my opinion about maruthi cars and recommend
    my friend to another brand car.<BR>
     <BR>
     I was thought about the Indian product cars will be the best and company
    can provide the best service. Unfortunately my bad luck to purchase WagonR
    car. <BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : Bought this car in July'09. Am just in love with this car.
    Driving comfort is way better than any cars in this segment. Space Space and
    Space everywhere. Mileage around 18kmpl on normal roads. Gear shifting is
    very smooth (atleast after 1st service) pickup is awesome. A/C is ok (it
    stopped working and i had it repaired at MASS). overall a very good family
    car.<BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : Hi.I must say that I am the proudest owner of my Black
    Wagonr lx. I bought this car on 28 feb, 2005. I went through all the reviews
    about wagon r(all models) and then thought that I must share my experience
    with you. I own four cars- Baleno, carburettor zen, wagon-r and a A/C800
    Deluxe. Let's talk about wagon-r in this segment and then you can see my
    comments for my 800 in the 800 segment reviews.<BR>
     <BR>
     After reading all the reviews of wagon r, I am proud to say that I get the
    maximum average out of a wagon-r in the entire India. I get 19.37 mileage in
    traffic roads of Delhi and 21 on highways at a constant speed of 140km/h.Can
    you beat that? Now there are reasons why my car is so happy with me. I BET
    IF YOU TAKE MY TIPS, YOUR WAGON-R HAS TO GIVE YOU THAT KIND OF AVG.--------
    <OL>
      <LI>IF YOUR CAR HAS BEEN STANDING FOR A LONG TIME, ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR
        ENGINE TO WARM UP AND THE TEMPERATURE NEEDLE TO COME IN THE MIDDLE OF H
        AND C.THIS IS THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE EVERY MORNING YOU TAKE HER OUT.
        WHY TO DO THIS??? BY THIS PRACTISE YOU ALLOW THE ENGINE OIL TO CIRCULATE
        IN THE ENTIRE ENGINE. IMAGINE YOU STARTING THE CAR IN THE MORNING AND
        THE ENGINE OIL IS ALL COOLED DOWN AND YOU START RUNNING THE VEHICLE. THE
        PARTS OF THE ENGINE NEED TO BE OILED BEFORE YOU START RUNNING HER.</LI>
      <LI>NEVER PULL HER UP IN THE 1,2,3 OR FOURTH GEAR. IF YOU PULL UP THE CAR
        IN THE 1,2, GEAR THEN YOU WILL BE PLAYING WITH CRANK AND PISTON AND IT
        MIGHT BREAK SOON. ALSO REMEMBER IT IS NOT A SPORTS CAR THAT YOU SHOULD
        PICK HER UP IN THE 1,OR THE 2 GEAR.</LI>
      <LI>I HAVE DONE A COMPLETE 168KMP/H ON MY WAGON-R WITH AN AVERAGE OF 21.
        DOES THAT SOUND UNUSUAL. SURE IT DOES. BUT HOW DID I DO IT. THE BEST
        TRICK OF THE TRADE FOR RACING THIS CAR---- RUN HER VERY SMOOTHLY WITH
        VERY SMOOTHE GEAR SHIFTS TILL THE 1,2,3,AND THE 4 GEAR. REMEMBER YOU
        DON'T NEED TO PRESS THE ACCELERATOR BUT JUST KEEP YOUR FOOT ON IT. THE
        MOMENT SHE TOUCHES 40 KMP/H, SHIFT TO 5TH GEAR AND PRESS THE ACCELARATOR
        TO THE FULLEST. THE MOMENT YOU PRESS IT DOWN ON 5TH GEAR AT 40KMP/H TILL
        THE MAXIMUM SPEED YOU ACTUALLY ALLOW THE COMBUSTION AND HEAT TO BUILD UP
        IN THE ENGINE AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO REACH THE MAXIXMUM SPEED IT HAS TO
        OFFER YOU. BUT IF YOU PRESS THE ACCEL ON EVERY GEAR AND PULL HER HARD ,
        YOU CAN BET ANYDAY THAT IT WILL NOT TOUCH 168KMP/H AND NOT GIVE YOU THAT
        KIND OF AVERAGE ANYDAY.</LI>
      <LI>MOVING OVER TO MILEAGE.----MY USUSAL MILEAGE IS 19.37 WHICH IS
        CONSTANT AND THAT'S IN PETROL BECAUSE I DONT HAVE ANY OTHER VARIANT AND
        MY AVERAGE DOES NOT VARY. THE REASONS WHY I GET THIS KIND OF MILEAGE IN
        DELHI TRAFFIC ROADS-----NO MATTER WHATEVER SPEED YOU ARE TRAVELLING AT,
        JUST DONT PRESS THE ACCEL ONLY GIVE A SLIGHT TAP ON THE ACCEL. IF YOU
        RUN YOUR VEHICLE AT 150 KMP/H AND STILL WANT A GOOD AVG. THEN THE TRICK
        IS THAT JUST KEEP THE ACCEL WHERE IT REQUIRES TO MAINTAIN THAT SPEED,
        DONT KEEP ON PRESSING THE ACCEL. BY THIS PRACTISE YOU WILL ENSURE THAT
        THERE IS CONSTANT FLOW OF FUEL AND NO VARIANCE. THE OTHER REASON WHY I
        GET A GOOD AVERAGE IS BECAUSE I ALWAYS WARM UP MY CAR ON IDLE IF THE
        TEMPERATURE NEEDLE IS ON COLD. THIS HELPS THE ENGINE OIL TO COME UP.
        HENCE IT'S TOTALLY WRONG TO SAY THAT TO GET A GOOD AVERAGE YOU SHOULD
        DRIVE THE CAR BETWEEN 45-55KMP/H AND I CAN PROVE THAT WRONG ANY DAY IN
        MY CAR.</LI>
      <LI>THE AIR- CONDITIONING OF THIS CAR IS EXCELLENT ONLY IF YOU KNOW HOW
        TO USE THE A/C OF A SMALL SEGMET CAR. OPEN ALL THE WINDOWS AND RUN YOU
        A/C/ ON MAXIMUM SO THAT THE COOL AIR CAN BRING UP THE HOT AIR INSIDE THE
        CAR AND THROW IT AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS. DO THIS FOR 2-3 MINUTES AND THEN
        ROLL UP THE WINDOWS AND BRING THE FAN SPEED TO 2 AND ENJOY THE CHILL
        FEELING.</LI>
      <LI>MY WAGON-R DOES NOT GIVE ME ANY PROBLEMS IN GEAR SHIFTS COZ I MAKE
        SURE THAT I PRESS THE FULL CLUTCH AND I KEEP MY HAND VERY SOFT WHILE
        SHIFTING THE GEARS. HEY!! DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE YOUR GEAROIL AFTER
        EVERY 10,000 K/M</LI>
    </OL>I have done 44,000 km/s In this car and it's doing excellent. I take it
    to Shimla and my car can easily climb the hill in 4th gear only if I don't
    have to break the speed in the middle. The handling and maneuvering part can
    be rated 7/10. As the car has height and is light wieghted.<BR>
     <BR>
     FEW MORE TIPS FOR YOUR ENGINE'S LONG LIFE.----USE CASTROL MAGNATEC AS YOUR
    ENGINE OIL AND TRY NOT TO CHANGE THE BRAND. FOR GEAR OIL YOU SHOULD USE
    SERVO AND JUST TRY TO FILL IN PETROL IN YOR CAR FROM 1 PARTICULAR PETRO PUMP
    RATHER THAN TESTING ALL PUMPS. SERVICE YOUR CAR AT 10,000 KMS AND CHANGE THE
    GEAR OIL IN EVERY SERVICE. CHANGE YOUR SPARK PLUGS AFTER EVERY 20,000 KMS.
    DO NOT LET ANYONE TOUCH THE SENSORS OF YOUR CAR WHICH ARE LOCATED ON THE
    RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE AIR FILTER BOX. THIS IS VERY SENSITIVE AND IS
    COMPUTER OPERATED BY A 32-BIT E.C.M. THE ENTIRE CAR IS CONTROLLED BY THIS
    ECM SO PLEASE DO NOT ALLOW ANY MECHANIC TO TOUCH THIS.<BR>
     <BR>
     Few important reminders again-----Dont push the accelerator on any gear but
    just keep it wherever you require it to maintain the speed AND ALWAYS SHIFT
    TO 5TH GEAR AT 40KM/H. Also dont forget to warm up the car if the
    temperature needle is indicating cold.<BR>
     <BR>
     My car is so smoothe to run and anexcellent drive. I have driven this car
    for continuous 16 hours on highway and i must say what a wonderful
    experience. <BR>
     <BR>
     <BR>
     Since I happen to know a little too much about this car so if you want any
    further tips or have questions or you want me to show you a demo practically
    in your car then you can always email me at markmatthews123@yahoo.co.in and
    the better thing to do will be to contact me on my cell at 9990007873.<BR>

     Just before I say good bye, here's another shocking news for you---With the
    above mentioned racing tricks I have defeated a scorpio, honda
    civic,sx4,swift,honda city(2008 version)and lancer with a 800 and on my
    wagon r as well. So if you don't believe me then just call me and I will

    <B>REVIEW</B> : Wagon R Complaints - Unsatisfactory service by M/s. POPULAR
    VEHICLES &amp; SERVICES Ltd, KILLIPALAM, TRIVANDRUM, KERALA.<BR>
     <BR>
     Sub : Customer Dissatisfaction <BR>
     Ref :- WagonR Duo KL 01 AQ 4033<BR>
     First of all before writing my complaint I am very sorry to inform that
    myself and my family members have lost our trust in Maruti because of the
    Unsatisfactory service given by one of the Maruti service dealer M/s.
    POPULAR VEHICLES &amp; SERVICES Ltd., as we all are using Maruti Vehicles
    for a long time but for the past three years the approach from Popular are
    making us to believe that its better not to take any Maruti Vehicle in
    future and also as a Media person the attitude from them make me to advice
    others not to think for Maruti products. <BR>
     With the ref: above, Its my humble request to look forward the matter.<BR>
     <BR>
     From the very first time itself they are not keeping their commitment,
    refer my complaint registration dt: 10th April 2007 at Maruthi Udyog
    regarding the delay of delivering my vehicle. This is a good example that I
    can show about there bad dealings, when I registered a complaint they gave
    the car on very next day ie: on 11th April 2007 without delay. Then after
    this incident also all the service including car washing till date was done
    there, still this time they are not keeping loyalty in there services. The
    complaints mentioned are still existing as follows:-
    <OL>
      <LI>The missing problem on LPG gas: - While driving in LPG I face some
        missing but when I shift to petrol mode the car runs properly.</LI>
      <LI>Steering Lock during long drive (Major issue) I have given it on 8th
        July 2009 and delivered on 10th July 2009, but still the concerned
        complaint was exits. Then I informed Mr. Sankar Babu, Customer Service
        Manager. The next day he came with a technician for a test drive and
        said that the problem is damperring, and it can be rectified by
        adjusting and on 13th July 2009, they had took the car for correcting
        this. By noon I had a test drive with Mr. Sankar Babu and the
        technician, during that time I felt it was ok. From the next day onwards
        the same problem occurs and when I spoke to Mr. Sankar Babu, he told it
        will get corrected after a long run. But its still exits after a long
        drive. I think they are waiting to expire the extended Warrenty
        (60,000km which is near to reach), to start the major work.</LI>
      <LI>Washing :- During the last time, I found that the car was not
        properly washed and I showed the dirt to them by removing the press type
        wheel cup in front of the supervisor. They are taking the cleaning Towel
        from the customers vehicle in every service, even if not for washing
        service. It shows that the service centre is not looking after the car,
        to get a better service, I called to Maruti call center on 23rd July
        2009 (Toll Free No: 18001800180) and spoke to Mr. Kishan and he took my
        mobile no. and promised me that somebody would be calling me at the
        earliest (Complaint NO: 6402096631). But till now there is no call.</LI>
    </OL>Waiting for your positive &amp; immediate response Jeeja Nadeer (Mob :-

    <B>REVIEW</B> : My White Wagon Duo has done 2600kms in 1 and a half
    months,ever since i got him on August 1st 2008. This is a practical car for
    big built and tall people like me,who need not crawl into even 3 times more
    costlier cars than the wagor r. I am running it on Gas only, with a boffling
    mileage of 15.6 with semi-A/C running im so glad and happy cos i never made
    a mistake, but worth the cost for the car. As what the MUL engineers keep
    saying, Handling the car with lesser gearshifts and keeping up with the
    power of the engine really gives a wonderful mileage. i can confidently say
    that my duo would touch the 17.5 km mark for petrol. I have never driven
    this car on petrol and i find gas to be smooth on the engine. I believe
    after 3000kms the engine would get set for gas, for what i am patiently
    waiting for. Service with ABT coimbatore is too good. AC is very nice and
    powerful. My piece of advice to my friends would be- Once u start your car
    in the morn, let it run for 2 to 3 kms while the orange light blinks, on
    petrol and after that sufficient lubrication of petrol in the pump a slight
    acceleration would change over to gas. I was told thats how a gas car should
    be handled for a longer engine life. I never switch the&#160; gas switch to
    petrol or gas (up n down). Its a cute car. fantastic EPS and 1060 cc power.
    This is our familys fourth wagon R. The duo stole my heart. I love my duo.<BR>

    mobility pune. Earlier we visited them on 4th to take a test drive of the
    vehicle. We were being told that there is wagon r duo available for test
    drive. We booked tickets from mumbai to pune to go and take a test drive of
    wagon r lxi duo. On visiting there we found that there is no vehicle vehicle
    available for test drive. We clarified the same in mumbai and there is wagon
    r lxi duo available for test drive for customers. This is nothing but a
    fraud and cheating with customer. Also we gave them 2nd option to give us a
    trial of the vehicle which we were planing to book. During that time we had
    paid the full amt but vehicle was not registered on us. Still the dealer
    refused. This is a clear indication of cheating with us and i am sure that
    my new vehicle will give problems in future for above scenario. Kindly look
    into this matter immediately the same is forwarded to maruti udyog on

    so good with some minor problems. The mileage has been good in highways
    around 16 KMPL and city quite not good around 13 KMPL. 2 problems I
    faced/currently face are [1] Windshield - It is not anti glare - I am
    getting a scattering when an opposite vehicle comes.. Sometimes I cannot see
    anything, which makes me blind. I changed the windshield but the new one is
    also the same. I tested my eyes and they are fine. My friends who drove the
    vehicle also complained the problem. [2] When AC is on, the pickup is poor.
    I tried to tune it during service but of no help. <BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : Hi you wagon R owners, the wagon R has a problem with the
    clutch assembly and MUL have a policy that if the customer doesn't complain,
    don't bother fixing it so your dealer will do nothing about it if you do not
    take it back and report it. There is a service repair action for this
    problem from MUL. Driving with the shift problem will only spoil the gearbox
    in the long run. <BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : I have owned a WagonR Vxi 2003 model &amp; I was in love
    with it. It was a terrific car with plenty of leg-room for all 4, great AC,
    very smooth power steering. Gave 17 kmph on highways and 13-14 kmph in city
    - with AC on. I loved this car and suggest its worth every paisa of money
    put in (esp for first time car buyer). It only has a slight issue with
    stability while turning at high speeds like&#160; 100 kmph (otherwise I
    never felt any issues). <BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : For all those who have mentioned the problem with shifting
    to reverse gear, let me emphasize on the fact that it is not just the WagonR
    but any car with a manual gear that will behave this way as its a known
    problem. The best way to overcome this problem is when you are unable to
    shift to reverse,get the lever back to neautral position and release the
    clutch once. Press the clutch again and engage to Reverse and there you
    go....! Try this and am sure there will not be more comments on this
    problem. <BR>
     And this is what my service advisor too advised me when I approached him
    with this problem<BR>

    using 2nd hand Santro DX. One major difference I see is there is slight
    problem with Gear shift, otherwise its good car. The pickup is good (in Gas
    as well). I am getting 12Kmpl in hyd city on Gas and 13-14 Kmpl on petrol.
    Overall its good car to possess. <BR>

    leg room. And very imp, the road view. None of the cars in this segment
    (swift or indica ...) can match this. But i face little difficulty in
    shifting gears espl reverse gear. To sum up, East or West WagonR s the BEST
    !!! <BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : I have purchased a WagonR from Maruti Dealer M/s Competent
    Gurgaon in January'07. I have shown my vehicle to three competent dealers
    including gurgaon and in Apra motors also. The problem was : 1-gear shifting
    2- Driving on LPG Air filter burst. Recently i had been to Apra third time
    for the LPG Problem and they have changed one part in the car and not
    changed the Air filter which was burst due to LPG. I am very much worried
    that if any thing happens then who will be the responsible, the dealer or
    Maruti.<BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : The Wagon R has delighted many of us since it was offered
    and I must say has had quite a success in all the markets in the world. Sold
    in Europe with a Vauxhall Badge and other places as a Chevy. Its roomy,
    bright and a good choice for first time buyers. It has a no non sense and
    eager 1.1 liter petrol mill, very frugal in nature when we speak of a car
    like this running in Town with four passengers and AC switched on. Best part
    is that it still commands a very nice resale value. Over 3 years and 80000
    kms this will still leave you with 55 - 60 % of your initial spending. You
    may change the body shape, but MUL, please don't do a Zen Estilo to the
    Wagon R. I hope MUL realises that some products are liked for their
    sillhuotte as well as its virtues... Only drawback - Its very FLIMSY !!<BR>

    tear my floor carpets have been slightly torn. As such I could not find any
    with the dealers at Siliguri and gangtok. The way of cleaning dirts inside
    the car as offered by Maruti is just hopeless. They blow air instead of
    vacummizing. Blowing of air just dislodges the dirt to spread it to the
    every nook and corner of the inside of the vehicle. Do you also think the
    same to clean the car. Some sort of vacumm cleaners should be given as free
    accessories instead of gold coins etc. Reply awaited. Facts and figures help
    to promote the business of the compony not false praises. I too love maruti
    vehicles than any other Indian cars but the way of its servicing is not that
    satisfactory as already stated as an example of blowing air inside the car.
    More facts after I receive any replies from MUL.<BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : Maruti WagonR<BR>
     A nice car overall.... Enough head &amp; legroom in the front... would have
    cherished a little bit lateral room in the back..but nevertheless, it's
    fine!! <BR>
     I simply love those extra room for cups, cans, goggles &amp; umbrella.. a
    great utility to have in any car. In Calcutta roads (a mix of city and
    highways), I'm getting an average of 13.5 - 14 KMpL with the AC kept on
    occasionally. Nice gears, excellent EPS.. good view of the road from the
    driving position... overall, I would definitely recommend WagonR as a city
    car.<BR>
     Suggestions: Power window on all the 4 windows and an internally adjustable
    rear view mirror would make this car just an ideal car for city driving. <BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : The car is pretty good overall. There seems to be sudden
    tiny bursts of acceleration or drop in power when accelerator is kept
    pressed with a constant force. Dont know whether this is because of petrol
    quality, onboard comp making adjustments or change in road slopes. I had the
    same experience with a Maruti 800. Does anybody know if this is because of
    MPFI TECHNOLOGY ?Never had this with a 98 model carburetted Zen. That car
    was a PLEASURE to drive.<BR>

    <B>REVIEW</B> : Comfort drive with good mileage <BR>
     i purchased maruti wagon-r lxi on 12th august 2005 from sai service, lower
    parel, mumbai. now till this date no any major problems arised. after sale
    service is also good from sai services. till this date there is running
    12000 km. some suggestions as follows may be useful to other wagon r owners.
    for good mileage - 45 to 55 kmph speed, in 5th gear or steady speed on 4 th
    and 5 th gear. i got maximum average as 24 km on mumbai-goa road from mumbai
    to khed-bharana naka.<BR>
     gear experience - good. some time reverse gear not operate instantaneously.
    otherwise gear operates good. medium smooth. hilly area driving - good for
    climbing, use 3 rd and 2 nd gear but on 4 th and 5 th gear also climb normal
    steepnes. steady speed should use. other wise mileage will down.<BR>
     in city area - use minimum gear change. drive 3 rd or 4 th gear in normal
    traffic like mumbai. but not in mohammad ali road`s terific traffic.
    otherwise there will be loss of milege.<BR>
     on bad stony road - driving on 2 nd 3 rd gear. steady accelration. on dusty
    or sandy road - go 4 th or 5 th gear no problame but when there is climbing
    put 2 nd gear. more steepy in dusty and stony hill drive 1 st gear and then
    use 2 nd gear after soft road appeard. <BR>
     maximum speed and good average - can drive smoothly on 120 kmph but milege
    will down in steady speed of 120 kmpl also. do not continous on this speed.
    for safety and good mileage drive 45 to 55 kmph steady speed is perfect. and
    will be good for long journey also.<BR>
     with ac - ac picks more power and got powerless driving particularly on
    hilly roads, pikup goes less, use ac regulator changing for 4-5 minutes. in
    city. on highway put ac regulator medium leval. will got the milege in ac
    for 45 to 55 kmph speed nearly 14 to 15 kmpl.<BR>
     speedometer - not good visual when driving. other wise driving condition is
    very good. can drive non stop 4-5 hrs. very comfortable driving climate.
    seating arrangement - very very good for 4 person with driver. total
    experience - very very good <BR>
     avg. mileage can get in city with ac 14 without ac 16, highway - with ac 15
    as per steady speed of 45 to 55 kmph. without ac can get mileage 20 to 24
    kmpl. steady non inturpting speed of 45 to 55 kmph.<BR>

    <B>POSTED ON</B> : April 10, 2006<BR>
    <B>REVIEW</B> : Excellent city car. i bought an LXi in Oct,2005.Wanted a
    compact car to tackle Mumbai city traffic. Happy with overall performance.
    Maneouverability, ease of driving, parking, comfort, all good. Best of all
    convenience - of a compact but spacy car with good leg room and good boot
    space.good for weekend family trips as well.<BR>
     Braking, suspension, avg of 10-11( with AC - mumbai city), not excellent
    but def.comparable in the segment.<BR>
     Sales and after sales very good so far from Sai Service. no real problems
    so far. Two services completed satisfactorily.<BR>
     All in all, definitely good value for money. i would say, ideal city car.</H2><BR>

    <B>POSTED ON</B> : April 6, 2006<BR>
    <B>REVIEW</B> : This car is very very good car , but dealers of Maruti
    Udyog Ltd in faridabad ( haryana) like Alfa Motor &amp; Batra Auto are very
    much cheaters , we had written complaint against them in maruti udyog ltd
    but we did not saw any action against them . Pl do not try to buy maruti car
    from faridabad dealers .<BR>

    <B>POSTED ON</B> : April 3, 2006<BR>
    <B>REVIEW</B> : Its tall seating position gives very good view of the road
    and the surrounding. There is lot of space for your cups, goggles, camera,
    coins and other such stuff. Engine is very responsive. The EPS is great, its
    fun to drive. It gave me 17 km/L on highways with mostly a/c ON but with
    temp knob at minimum cooling. At the higher fan speeds it blows sound. The
    car is very stable up to the speed of 90-100. But above 120, I never felt
    comfortable, even on pune-mumbai expressway! Its not a car for high speed
    driving. I found it is very good and comfortable on typical countryside bad
    roads.<BR>
     The side mirror is very inconvenient to adjust. They should provide an
    internally adjustable one. <BR>
     Overall it is very good car. Great blend of fun, fashion, practicality and
    value for your money. I strongly recommend this car. The maruti service
    experience is also very good.<BR>

    <B>POSTED ON</B> : March 4, 2006<BR>
    <B>REVIEW</B> : If you are Tall and heavily built, this is definitely the
    car for you. Much more leg room than any other car in its class for the
    drivers. EPS gives effortless driving pleasure. I have completed 5000 Km's
    now without a single hitch. Gear shift is little notchy with long throws,
    but definitely value for money car. Milage with low A/C in Bangalore is 11.2
    KMPL. In Highway it gave me around 16 with A/c.<BR>
