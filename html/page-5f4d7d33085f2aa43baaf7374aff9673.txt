                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">In 1976, Honda launched the roomier Accord as a complement to its relatively new Civic and the model grew significantly in its second and third generations. The fourth generation, which kicked off in 1990, pushed the Accord even further, as Honda debuted the station wagon variant. For 1993, the Accord Wagon was available in the LX and EX trim levels.</p>

The 2007 Subaru Legacy GT wagon features a more powerful motor and a larger set of features than the 2011 Subaru Outback. These two vehicles also have different interior and exterior dimensions.</p>

                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">A masquerade ball is a formal event that involves wearing intricate masks with period costumes. When you're attending a masquerade ball, the way you wear your hair affects how your mask and costume look. Knowing how to do your hair for a masquerade ball doesn't require expert styling knowledge, but a little patience and time is key. A well-styled 'do will make you stand out among other guests at your next masquerade event.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Nothing lasts forever, as the old adage goes, and that is especially true when you're in a failing marriage. It's hard to say goodbye to someone you once loved enough to wed, but it's harder to remain in a relationship that is strained beyond repair. Knowing how to leave a failing marriage requires determination to change the situation in which you find yourself and pursue a life outside of unhappiness.</p>

                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">The 2003 Volkswagen Passat station wagon shared the same trim levels as the sedan body style. The GLX sat above the GL and GLS models, and shared the same creature comforts as the W8, but without the eight-cylinder engine. Volkswagen did not offer the Passat station wagon with the brand's bare-bones G trim level.</p>

                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">During the first part of the 20th century and extending into the 1970s, even, it was common for coach builders to exercise their creative minds using existing models. During the 1950s and 1960s, builders like Binz, Miessen and IMA were building station wagons on existing Mercedes saloon models. IMA was the only outside company contracted by Mercedes to build estate models and its ideas influenced later in-house built estate wagons.</p>

The Taurus was fully redesigned for 1996 with curvaceous styling utilizing oval styling cues throughout the body. The wagon was only offered in GL and LX trims, while the sedan was also offered in entry-level G and performance-oriented SHO trims.</p>

                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">The Pontiac Vibe was a Toyota Matrix station wagon clone and the last surviving Pontiac before General Motors shuttered the division in 2010. The 2005 first generation Vibe came in the base and GT trim levels. It featured reasonable power from a modest four-cylinder engine. The sleek and roomy Vibe was the perfect antidote to the disastrous design-by-committee 2001-to-2005 Pontiac Aztek crossover that consistently ranks as one of the ugliest cars ever built.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">The 2007 Chrysler PT Cruiser came with a choice of a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder or a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine. Because there were only two engines available for the 2007 PT Cruiser, identifying the particular engine installed in your car is straightforward and only requires inspecting the engine compartment briefly. The turbocharged engine uses a turbocharger system to provide additional power to the PT Cruiser. Turbochargers feed off the car's exhaust system.</p>

The HHR does not come with a push-button start or any other special system, so turning off the vehicle is straightforward and similar to the process in other cars. You'll turn off the HHR in the same way you turned it on: by using the ignition key. Some HHR models are equipped with a remote start key fob. If you've used the remote start to turn the car on, you can cancel the remote start function and turn the engine off with the key fob.</p>

While having access to a bit more performance makes driving a Turbo more enjoyable, it can also put some strain on your gasoline bill. Some drivers purchase fuel additives that claim to increase mileage, but these are dubious at best. Instead, it is easy to make any PT Cruiser more fuel efficient by doing a little basic maintenance and paying attention to your driving style.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Fuel injectors spray fuel into the engine to be gradually burnt. They are installed in the majority of cars that do not make use of a carburetor. Dirty fuel injectors on a Holden Commodore can lead to dirty emissions through the fuel exhaust pipe and also affect the vehicle's overall performance. It is possible to effectively clean the fuel injectors without having to remove it from the body of the Commodore by closely following these steps.</p>

A dirty fuel injector in a Buick Century can lead to dirty exhaust emissions and can also affect the Buick's overall performance. Cleaning a Buick Century's fuel injector, a moderately easy task, does not require you to remove it from the car frame.</p>

These big models were later discontinued when smaller sedans and sports utility vehicles became American's favorite family vehicle. Buying a good condition classic Chevrolet station ensures a high future resale value. The 1967 Chevrolet station wagon's Fisher body plate on the bonnet's right side assists identification; the number 7 in the sixth place on the plate means 1967. Look for the engine code stamp on the engine block's top, right or front.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">The 2009 Nissan Versa has an adjustable driver-side seat. In addition to being able to push the seat forward or back, you can recline it. You can also adjust the driver-side seat's height. This is a helpful feature, because not all drivers are the same height. If you are shorter, raising the seat can help give you a clearer view of the road. If you are taller, lowering the seat can give you additional headroom.</p>

                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">The Mercedes R350 is part of the Mercedes R-Class. It is a crossover wagon, similar to a station wagon. The Mercedes R350 comes with a cigarette lighter that is not immediately visible; it's stored inside a storage compartment. The lighter is connected to the vehicle's power outlet. By removing the cigarette lighter, you can use the power outlet to charge your cell phone, or to connect other electrical items.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid8 Alpha Omega excerpt">The Golf is a Volkswagen hatchback that was redesigned for the 2010 model year. It is essentially a descendant of the popular Rabbit, which VW began producing in the 1970s. One feature that continues on the 2010 Golf is that the rear seats fold down to create an enlarged cargo area that stretches from the hatchback door to the back of the front seats. Folding the seats down to create this cargo area is a simple process that requires no tools.</p>
