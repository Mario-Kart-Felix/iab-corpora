<p align="left"><strong>Hybrid Cars: List Of Real Drawbacks To
Owning A Hybrid Vehicle</strong><br>
By Alex Baumm</p>

<p align="left">As oil prices continue to increase amid
depleting supplies and rapid growth in demand, all economies
globally are feeling the setbacks of the need to curtail
excessive consumption of fuel.</p>

<p align="left"><img id="D#images/toyota%20prius.jpg"

     selling hybrid vehicles</p>

<p align="left">For quite some time, research and development
has been actively finding ways on how problems regarding very
high demand could finally be eliminated. With the advent of the
hybrid car, car owners and users all over the world are now
finding relief that indeed there is hope.</p>

<p align="left">A hybrid car is a specially designed and
manufactured vehicle that combines the power of the
conventional gasoline engine and electricity. In the past, many
have referred to hybrid vehicles as electric vehicles.</p>

<p align="left">Technically, a hybrid car could not be
classified as purely electric because only about 40% of the
energy consumption of the vehicle is from electric sources, in
the form of stored electricity in batteries.</p>

<p align="left">Though the wide use of hybrid cars provide hope
that in the future, when oil supplies finally and completely
runs out, the transportation industry would not feel the
drawback. Yes, for now, driving a hybrid auto could equate to a
lot of savings on<br>
the part of the car owner.</p>

<p align="left">At least, the overall consumption of oil could
be significantly lowered. Research is still ongoing so that in
the near future, further better versions of the modern hybrid
auto could be developed and launched into the market.</p>

<p align="left">However, just like many other predecessor
technologies, there are actual setbacks to owning and using a
hybrid car. Many people hope that in the coming months or
years, people could finally realize a better and more effective
hybrid car. Here are the most practical and obvious of those
drawbacks.</p>

<p align="left">1. Because the hybrid car technology is still a
relatively new car technology, it is just logical that the
vehicle is expensive. On the average, a hybrid car these days
costs more than the regular and usual cars by around $2,000 to
$5,000. That is just right and is expected with the high demand
for the car as more consumers get excited about it and
manufacturers continue to produce the vehicle models on a
limited ability.</p>

<p align="left">2. Any hybrid car needs to allot a significant
amount of space for battery. Because the hybrid car needs
batteries to keep it going and for the use of some if its
functions, the overall weight of the car gets more and
more.</p>

<p align="left">3. There are several states in the United
States and some other global governments globally that are
charging more additional fees and other charges for acquisition
and registration.</p>

<p align="left">4. If the hybrid car gets into possible crashes
and collisions in the future, there is a risk that the incident
would be more tragic. A hybrid car typically and normally has
high voltage wires within it.</p>

<p align="left">5. A regular and even simple hybrid car is made
of a very complicated car system. Thus, ordinary mechanics
would not have the needed and required skills and knowledge to
attend to any technical need for maintenance of any hybrid
car.</p>

<p align="left">6. Because hybrid cars are still not too
rampant and ordinary, buying spare parts may be very hard, if
not impossible. Further, costs of spare parts can be very
expensive.</p>

<p align="left">7. It is a common knowledge that hybrid cars
run slower than regular car models.</p>
