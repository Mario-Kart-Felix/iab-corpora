					<span class="fontsize3boldblue">
					<p class="MsoBodyText2">Over the last 25 years of owning 
					many different types of vehicles and equipment my main 
					concern was always to determine how I could achieve the 
					maximum performance and durability as well as significantly 
					increase the longevity of the vehicle, far beyond what the 
					manufacturer designed and tested the components and vehicle 
					to last for. Here are a few of the many items that I found 
					work very well in achieving this goal:<font SIZE="2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
					<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
						<li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">
						Ball Joints</span></b><span style="font-size:
     12.0pt">: these always seem to be a problem with me. Every single vehicle I 
						have owned has required ball joints at a fairly low 
						mileage.&nbsp; I become quite upset when I remove the OEM 
						parts and find they are either frozen and do not move or 
						are extremely loose. The failed ball joints resulted in 
						sloppy or erratic steering, alignment problems and 
						excessive tire wear.&nbsp; The problem I have found is that 
						the original ball joints do not come with grease 
						fittings. There are supposed to be ealed for life, 
						however I find that is hardly the case. I do not replace 
						them with the manufacturers parts because the same thing 
						is bound to happen again. I have always purchased NAPA 
						premium quality ball joints designed for severe duty 
						fleet use that come with grease fittings.&nbsp; Since I began 
						doing this on every vehicle I have never had another 
						ball joint failure. I periodically grease the ball 
						joints with AMSOIL Heavy-Duty Synthetic NLGI #2, GC/LB 
						moly-based grease.</span></li>
					</ol>

						U-Joints</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">:&nbsp;

						recently replaced the front axle U-Joints on one of my 
						heavy-duty 4x4 trucks and was told that for that size of 
						U-joint that the original manufacturer does not make one 
						with a grease fitting. I went to my local NAPA auto 
						parts and they had the U-Joints available with grease 
						fittings, which I purchased and installed.</span></li>

						Rust and Corrosion Protection</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">:&nbsp; 
						Today cars and trucks offer much improved sheet metal 
						and chassis component rust protection that older 
						vehicles, however for myself it is still not good 
						enough. I take every one of my trucks to Texaco 
						Rustproofing to be coated. This is a very specialized 
						material. It is very thick and gooey and must be heated 
						in order to be applied with special pumping and spray 
						equipment. It is applied at approximately 1/8-1/4 inch 
						thickness on the entire underside of the vehicle as well 
						as inside all doors and sheet metal panels. It does not 
						harden, crack and fall off over time like other 
						competitive products do that I have tested. It develops 
						a kin on the surface but the product under the skin 
						remains relatively soft and pliable.&nbsp; On extremely hot 
						summer days it can sometimes ooze out of panels which is 
						not a problem as there is plenty of product thereto 
						prevent corrosion that stays in place, however it is 
						very important to take a screwdriver and make sure the 
						drain holes at the bottom of doors and tailgates are not 
						plugged or they will retain water inside.</span></li>

						Shock Absorbers</span></b><span style="font-size:
     12.0pt">:&nbsp; I have also had just about every OEM shock absorber fail at a 
						relatively early age. I replace them with premium 
						quality aftermarket shock absorbers and get much better 
						performance and longevity. Recently on one of my 
						heavy-duty diesel trucks I was wearing flat spots all 
						around the center of my front tires. What I determined 
						was happening is that the tires were leaving the road 
						surface and upon re-contact with the road eventually 
						wore these flat spots on the tires. The factory shocks 
						were not strong enough to effectively keep the tires on 
						the road. I installed an aftermarket dual shock kit with 
						heavy duty gas charged off road shocks and immediately 
						solved my problem. You would think the manufacturer 
						would have figured this out. My 1987 lighter duty trucks 
						came factory equipped with dual front shocks while my 
						1999 heavy duty truck with an extremely heavy diesel 
						engine option came with only single front shocks.</span></li>

						Synthetic lubricants are available for engines, 
						transmissions, differentials, transfer cases, steering

						in this website, synthetic lubrication is far superior 
						to petroleum based lubrication and has been proven to 
						drastically reduce wear as well as increase performance 
						under all conditions, increase fuel economy and save 
						significant amounts of time and money in the process. 
						Just because a person uses petroleum oil and changes it 
						often does not mean that they will get anywhere near the 
						protection a premium quality synthetic oil provides.&nbsp; 
						They may feel good because they think they are doing 
						something beneficial by constantly changing the 
						petroleum oil, however they could be doing a lot less 
						work and saving money in the process while providing

						and longevity for your vehicle. I personally utilize 
						AMSOIL oiled foam air filters and by-pass oil filtration 
						systems on every single truck I own and attribute my 
						vehicles incredible longevity and performance to these 
						systems. Do not attempt to save money by purchasing low 
						cost filtration products. The old adage you get what

						matter if you want optimum or average performance and

							<b>and Value.</b><br>
							<br>
							That's what today's savvy consumers want.<br>
							<br>
							According to marketing analysts, the average 
							consumer no longer accepts general sales pitches 
							full of empty promises. The Internet gives consumers 
							instant access to nearly every possible product or 
							service. They look for quality information, conduct 
							price comparisons and then make buying decisions.<br>
							<br>
							The bottom line: more bang for their buck. And when 
							that consumer is raising seven children, top quality 
							products and savings are an even greater priority.<br>
							<br>
							Scott Boring, Oakfield, N.Y., has seven children 
							with his wife Teri. He's looking for quality and 
							savings to keep his 1997 GMC Yukon, with a 5.7 litre 
							V-8 engine that &quot;isn't noted for gas mileage,&quot; 
							running down the road carrying his large family as 
							efficiently as possible.<br>
							<br>
							A friend told Boring about AMSOIL products. He 
							promised better gas mileage - an important selling 
							point with today's high gasoline prices - more 
							efficient performance and longer life.<br>
							<br>
							The vehicle had 40,000 miles on it when Boring 
							installed AMSOIL products bumper to bumper.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;I did it all at one time, just to see the 
							difference,&quot; Boring said. He installed 
		<a href="svo.htm">AMSOIL Severe Gear 75W-140 Synthetic Gear Oil</a>, used AMSOIL Engine 
							Flush and then installed <a href="amo.htm">AMSOIL 10W-40 Synthetic 
							High Performance Motor Oil</a> and <a href="atf.htm">AMSOIL Universal 
							Automatic Transmission Fluid. </a> <br>
							<br>
							&quot;I especially like the ATF,&quot; Boring said. &quot;The truck 
							shifts smoother and the transmission is quiet. All 
							you hear is the tires on the ground. I've tried 
							other synthetics, lots of them. I just never saw any 
							difference. But, with AMSOIL, I saw a difference 
							right away.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							The first tankful of gasoline increased his mileage 
							from 15 mpg to 20.5 mpg. &quot;I swear I didn't believe 
							it,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm averaging between 19 and 21 mpg 
							all the time.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;This stuff is awesome and I'm letting all my 
							friends know about it.&quot;</p>

		</b><br>
		Although results vary because of a variety of factors, a common 
		denominator among AMSOIL motor oil users is an improvement in fuel 
		economy.<br>
		<br>
		Independent testing reveals that <a href="sso.htm">AMSOIL Signature Series 0W-30</a> motor oil 
		passes the API Energy Conservation Sequence VI test with a rating 38 
		percent higher than the API minimum specifications.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;The test results show that AMSOIL has the potential to save energy by 
		conserving fuel,&quot; said Technical Services Manager Ed Kellerman. &quot;In most 
		cases it can increase mileage, but at the very least you're getting 
		superior engine protection.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ralph Sites, a police officer in Rustburg, VA, said he put<a href="mcf.htm"> AMSOIL 10W-40 
		Synthetic Motorcycle Oil</a> in his 2002 GL 1800 Honda Gold Wing when it had 
		4,550 miles on the engine.
		&quot;I had been getting 30 miles per gallon,&quot; Sites said. &quot;I was supposed to 
		be getting 40 to 45 miles per gallon.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		His first oil change to AMSOIL improved his mileage to 38 miles per 
		gallon. At 6,500 miles on the engine, after replacing the final drive 
		oil with <a href="svg.htm">AMSOIL Severe Gear 75W-90 Gear Lube</a>, he improved to 40 miles 
		per gallon.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I switched to AMSOIL for the long-term gain. The improved gas mileage 
		was just a bonus. AMSOIL is less expensive than Honda's synthetic and I 
		don't have to change it as often. It's a win-win situation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		He bought the bike new in January 2002 and had put 12,000 miles on it in 
		August. He said the improved mileage he's gotten since switching to 
		AMSOIL has saved him $102 just in gasoline.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Jeff Bailey in Fulton, Mo., said his 1996 <b>Lexus GS300 with 81,000 
		miles on it also gained fuel efficiency when he switched to AMSOIL </b>
		motor oil.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;The car wants premium gasoline,&quot; he said. &quot;I drive about 18,000 miles a 
		year. I ordered your synthetic product and absolutely astounded.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I was used to getting about 20 mpg overall and having a little low-rev 
		torque.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Since switching to AMSOIL motor oil, Bailey gets 24 mpg and uses regular 
		gasoline.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;The engine feels even more flexible,&quot; he said. &quot;I've used AMSOIL now 
		for my wife's anemic Camry 2.2 litre and have calculated that I have 
		saved about $120,&quot; he said. &quot;Thanks AMSOIL for an awesome product. You 
		have a customer for life.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Likewise, Lance Okeson of St. Paul, Minn., gained miles per gallon after 
		switching to AMSOIL motor oil in his 1995 Cutlass Supreme.<br>
		<br>
		Okeson made the switch after learning about AMSOIL from a customer of 
		his at a quick lube where he works. His customer was so enthusiastic 
		about AMSOIL, Okeson did some research on the AMSOIL Website and decided 
		to try the products. A trip from the Twin Cities to Fargo, N.D., in a 
		steady 17 mile-per-hour wind, and back showed him an increase from 24 
		mpg to 30.5 mpg.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I have never gotten 30 plus mpg with that car,&quot; Okeson said. &quot;I have 
		two other vehicles that I switched over to AMSOIL motor oil. One is a 
		4x4 and the other is an old muscle car. I switched the transmissions and 
		the differentials in those vehicles as well.&quot;<br>

							&quot;He always made fun of me for only changing the oil

							</strong><br>
							Peter Virgona of Merrick, N.Y. is a self-proclaimed 
							oil enthusiast.
							I do a great deal of reading and research, always 
							looking for the best
							oil, Virgona said. The more I read the more I 
							realized AMSOIL was the
							best true synthetic I could buy. After using Mobil 
							1 since 1986, I made
							the switch to AMSOIL.<br>
							<br>
							Virgona is a warehouse worker, but he has many years 
							of experience working
							on cars.<br>
							<br>
							He drives a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria that has nearly 
							98,000 miles on the
							engine. He switched from Mobil 1 to 
							<a href="asl.htm">AMSOIL 5W-30 
							Synthetic Motor Oil (ASL).</a><br>
							<br>
							The difference was immediate and significant, 
							Virgona said. The idle
							became much smoother. There are times I cant tell 
							if the car is running.
							It also became much more responsive to the gas 
							pedal, so much more
							responsive my wife asked me what I did to the car.<br>
							<br>
							Virgona has owned the car for almost nine years. 
							Not surprisingly, the gas
							mileage improved significantly, he said. This car 
							always averaged 15
							miles per gallon going back and forth from work. It 
							now averages 16.5 mpg.
							Thats a 10 percent increase. I truly didnt expect 
							such a big change.<br>
							<br>
							He waited to report his findings until after he had 
							driven the car at least
							5,000 miles to confirm that the numbers are average 
							and not just a fluke.<br>
							<br>
							Virgona also has installed Ea Air and 
							<a href="eao.htm">Oil Filters</a> in 
							his vehicles.<br>
							<br>
							He told his sister-in-law about AMSOIL and then 
							changed her oil over to
							AMSOIL 5W-30. She drives a 1996 Dodge Caravan with a 
							3.0 litre V6 engine.
							According to Virgona, she had always used 
							conventional motor oil with
							regular oil changes every 3,000 miles.<br>
							<br>
							Nonetheless, she had a significant amount of sludge 
							that was obvious under
							the oil fill cap, he said. She also experienced a 
							very loud lifter noise
							that would come and go. Presumably, the sludge was 
							affecting the oil
							circulation to the lifters.<br>
							<br>
							Oil consumption in the van was also increasing, 
							using about one quart every
							1,500 to 2,000 miles.<br>
							<br>
							I switched the van to AMSOIL and put in a new 
							filter, Virgona said.
							Within 1,000 miles the lifter noise was all but 
							gone. By 3,000 miles,
							virtually all the sludge was gone. I drained and 
							refilled the oil a second
							time with AMSOIL 5W-30. The oil consumption is now 
							down to one quart every
							3,000 miles, with no more lifter noise.<br>
							<br>
							I am very happy with AMSOIL and plan to use it from 
							now on. I recommend it
							to anyone who wants a great synthetic oil.<br>
							<br>
							Virgona buys his products through the AMSOIL 
							website. I always get my
							product within 48 hours, he said. In fact, he just 
							had a case shipped to
							his father in-law in Florida because he believes in 
							AMSOIL products and
							wants others to experience their benefits. In fact, 
							hes considering
							becoming a <a href="distributoropportunities.htm">Dealer</a>.<br>
							<br>
							Virgona respects that he can get detailed technical 
							information about
							AMSOIL just by checking the website. AMSOIL puts 
							out performance test
							results for everyone to see. I definitely appreciate 
							that.<br>
							<br>
							People are usually very, very loyal to AMSOIL. They 
							know its the best.</span></p>

		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>AMSOIL Gives 
		Life to a Sweet Old Cadillac. Making a skeptic into a believer again.</b><br>
		<br>
		Dear AMSOIL, </p>
		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">I thought you 
		might appreciate hearing my AMSOIL story. When the opportunity arose 
		last year to purchase my mother-in-law's 1987 Cadillac DeVille, I jumped 
		at the chance. A true low mileage survivor, it was in near pristine 
		condition. I was proudly showing it off to a mechanic friend when he 
		said, &quot;Uh-oh, you bought an HT-4100? Good luck buddy.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		After much research I understood what he meant. The HT-4100 was rumored 
		to be one of the most troublesome engines Cadillac ever built. The 
		problems are numerous: an aluminum block with cast iron heads that 
		expand and contract at different rates causing premature head and intake 
		gasket failure, coolant loss into the oil, and finally main and rod 
		bearing failure. They also have a heavily loaded distributor gear, weak 
		timing gears, and sludging issues.<br>
		<br>
		My first thought was, if ever an engine needed AMSOIL, it's this one. I 
		first heard about AMSOIL at the old Brohman Dragway in the late 1970s 
		from a fellow racer who swore by it. For the past 10 years, I've used 
		various synthetic oils with favorable results, but never AMSOIL. Then I 
		talked with Dave Mann, the AMSOIL Dealer in my home town, and told him 
		my story. Having spent 19 years as a lubrication specialist with Ford, 
		Dave knows his stuff. He made several recommendations, and shared with 
		me his excellent e-book on motor oils.<br>
		<br>
		I also asked around at the Cadillac owners group I belong to, and almost 
		every one of them said, &quot;Don't buy AMSOIL! It's too expensive and won't 
		do you any good. You need this or that oil with this or that additive,&quot; 
		and so on. So who was I to believe? <br>
		<br>
		Having spent over 25 years in advertising and marketing, I have a strong 
		skepticism for extravagant claims made by manufacturers. Usually, when 
		you hear impressive adjectives like &quot;advanced&quot; and &quot;superior,&quot; someone 
		just wants your money or your vote (or both). So I read the science; 
		from AMSOIL and from several independent studies. I came to the 
		conclusion that it really is an excellent product. It also intrigued me 
		that one of the primary sales points made by AMSOIL is to convince you 
		to buy LESS of their product. That kind of marketing is contrary to 
		anything I've experienced, and elevates AMSOIL's credibility level 
		exponentially.<br>
		<br>
		I switched the Cadillac over to <a href="asl.htm">AMSOIL 5W-30 (ASL)</a> last fall, then put 
		in <a href="atm.htm">AMSOIL 10W-30 (ATM)</a> this spring (even though it's not a turbo, I like 
		the extra wear protection offered by this formula). Rather than letting 
		the oil go a full year, I change it every six months, during which time 
		it accumulates about 6,000 miles. My dad was an auto mechanic and taught 
		the 3,000-mile oil change rule like it was the 11th commandment - that 
		kind of conditioning is hard to overcome. With this frequency, I still 
		spend less money than if I changed the oil on a three-month/3,000-mile 
		schedule. I use the money I save to have drain samples tested by an 
		independent lab each time.<br>
		<br>
		The Deville now has 50,000 miles and runs like a fine Swiss watch. I 
		have not had a single problem with the 'troublesome' HT-4100 engine. It 
		runs roughly 10 degrees cooler than with regular oil, and my gas mileage 
		has increased by 10%. It has become my mission to get 200,000 miles from 
		this car. With AMSOIL, I might just make it. </p>
		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><br>
		As an addendum, I also recently switched my wife's 2003 Oldsmobile 
		Silhouette minivan to AMSOIL. Since we've owned it, this car has had a 
		lifter clatter for the first 10 seconds on cold starts. Literally, on 
		the first start after putting in AMSOIL, the clatter was gone.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks AMSOIL. By making a superb product that truly does what you say 
		it will do, you've given new life to a sweet old Cadillac, and made a 
		believer out of this devout skeptic. (<a target="_blank" href="cadillac_tc.htm">see

		<p align="left">Hayes Diversified Technologies (HDT), located in 
		Hesperia, California, produces diesel powered tactical military 
		motorcycles for the U.S. armed services as well as the UK and EU NATO 
		countries. Founded in 1961, the company originally manufactured 
		electro-mechanical switches and relays to the military &amp; aerospace 
		industries.<br>
		<br>
		The new HDT motorcycles are diesel machines combining both power and 
		environmentally friendly performance efficiency. We are talking about a 
		bike that gets 100 miles to the gallon AND can do 100 mph.</p>
		<p align="left">The HDT team was out on the Bonneville Salt Flats 
		earlier this month, striving to establish new national and world 
		records. Displaying the AMSOIL colors while going through the paces at 
		Bonneville, they offered up quite a number of very strong endorsements 
		with virtually no prompting. We noticed an increase in horsepower right 
		away when compared to Delvac 1, said Fred Hayes, founder/CEO of HDT. 
		What was quite surprising was the condition of the engine after a 
		50-mile run-in and over 120 full-throttle dyno runs. The camshaft 
		bearings, the small and large end rod bearings, didn't even look like 
		they had been run. During that series of dyno runs, we registered the 
		highest horse-power and torque readings ever.<br>
		<br>
		Dave Anderson, AMSOIL Technical Product Manager, had flown to Bonneville 
		to witness and participate in the pursuit of new land speed records. 
		Hayes said to Anderson, &quot;Our testing proved that <a href="hdd.htm">AMSOIL Series 3000 
		5W-30 Heavy Duty Diesel Oil</a> provided better cam bearing lubrication, 
		better transmission operation and less blow-by than our previous oil. We 
		picked up just over one horse power at the rear well.&quot; This is a 3.7% 
		increase and worth a 1 tooth higher gear ratio. In addition, it appears 
		that overall coolant temperature was down about five degrees. That is 
		roughly a 2.5% decrease in operating temperatures. <br>
		<br>
		Very few bikers would be opposed to increased horsepower with lower 
		operating temps, simply by switching over the lubricants.<br>
		<br>
		With over a year of testing, we have found that AMSOIL products 
		continually outperform all other lubricants. AMSOIL provides improved 
		performance, increased fuel economy, lower oil consumption, and 
		significantly reduced engine wear in all operating conditions.<br>

							Grain Hauler</b><br>
							<br>
							Burnell Keller of Castroville, Texas hauls a lot of 
							corn. Saving downtime and maintenance costs boost 
							his bottom line.<br>
							<br>
							Since the 1960s, Keller Grain, Inc., at Castroville 
							has bought high quality white and yellow corn from 
							local farmers and trucked it to processing plants 
							across the state of Texas. &quot;These trucks put on 
							about 12,000 miles a month,&quot; said Keller, the 
							company's owner.<br>
							<br>
							He was running Exxon XD3-30 motor oil in his 
							Freightliner and changing it every 10,000 miles. He 
							heard AMSOIL products could cut his operating and 
							maintenance costs in half, provide better fuel 
							economy, easier starts and extended oil drains at 
							least three times longer than he was getting.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;We were fixing to extend the drain to 15,000 
							miles,&quot; Keller said. &quot;But a sample of the Exxon 
							motor oil analyzed at 10,000 miles came back saying 
							the oil needed to be changed. I said, let's give 
							AMSOIL a whirl.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							After an engine flush, Keller installed 
		<a href="ame.htm">AMSOIL 
							15W-40 Heavy Duty Diesel and Marine Oil</a> in his 
							Freightliner, with more than 400,000 miles on the 
							engine.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;We did this procedure three times at a 15,000-mile 
							analysis and filter change only,&quot; Keller said. &quot;Each 
							time the oil sample report came back saying the oil 
							was good for continued use.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							After the third round of analysis, the oil was 
							changed. Keller plans to continue with 15,000-mile 
							analysis and filter changes and to continue to use 
							the same oil for an interval of 50,000 miles.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;That's about five times longer than before,&quot; Keller 
							said. &quot;It's very good. Keller Grain is now convinced 
							that AMSOIL is a superior product and that anybody 
							can save money using AMSOIL products.&quot;</p>

		<p align="left">Preferred Customer Lyle Reinier from Mesa, Ariz. has 
		been using AMSOIL products for four years with complete satisfaction. He 
		said that when he started using them in his 2001 Dodge Ram they changed 
		the way it ran.<br>
		<br>
		Now Reinier drives a 2004 Dodge Ram. He uses AMSOIL Synthetic 5W-30 in 
		the engine, <a href="atf.htm">AMSOIL Synthetic Universal Automatic Transmission Fluid
		</a>in 
		the transmission and 80W-140 Long Life Gear Lube.<br>
		<br>
		AMSOIL has given this truck life that it was hiding before, said 
		Reinier. Reinier said the Ram now pulls stronger and runs smoother than 
		it did before. He made the switch to AMSOIL when the truck hit the 
		3,000-mile mark. What comes as a surprise to me is that my Dodge dealer 
		had no problem doing a complete drain and fill with AMSOIL, said 
		Reinier.<br>
		<br>
		Reinier said the dealer removed all the Dodge transmission fluid and 
		refilled the truck with AMSOIL ATF. Within a mile or two I could feel 
		the transmission was smoother and showed a difference in how it 
		performed, said Reinier.<br>
		<br>
		Reinier also uses AMSOIL in his dirt bikes. He and his wife have been 
		using <a href="aff.htm">AMSOIL 0W-40 Formula 4-Stroke</a> since it was introduced. Within the 
		last year, Reinier performed a big bore and a valve job on their bikes 
		in search of more power.<br>
		<br>
		The insides of the cases, transmission gears and crank shafts were all 
		like brand-new, said Reinier.</p>
		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Reinier said the cylinder walls of each bike still 
		showed some cross hatching from the original bore. He also said the 
		bikes run quieter, smoother and cooler than they did before the switch 
		to AMSOIL. Both bikes have their original clutches and have logged over 
		4,000 trail miles.</p>
		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Customer 
		Discovers a Burning Desire For AMSOIL</b><br>
		<br>
		Dealer Mark Licht of Andover, N.J., was on a follow-up visit at Jimmy's 
		Service, Inc., of Hackettstown, N.J., when the integrity of AMSOIL ATF 
		was put to a new, on-the-spot test.<br>
		<br>
		Licht showed shop owner Jimmy Naranjo several pieces of literature on 
		oil and ATF testing results. After listening to Licht talk about the 
		benefits of AMSOIL ATF, Naranjo turned to him and said, &quot;You're full of 
		it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Licht continued to explain all the features and benefits that 
		<a href="atf.htm">AMSOIL ATF</a> 
		has to offer, but Naranjo interrupted and told him, &quot;There is only one 
		way to prove this ATF is any good.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Naranjo went to his shelf and opened two brands of transmission fluid he 
		uses and poured some of each onto his metal workbench. The shop owner 
		than poured some AMSOIL ATF next to the other two brands. &quot;I had no idea 
		what this guy was about to do,&quot; said Licht.<br>
		<br>
		Naranjo then took out his torch and put the flame directly on the first 
		brand of transmission fluid he commonly used. After about 30 seconds the 
		little puddle of transmission fluid started smoking. Naranjo proceeded 
		to the second brand he stocked in his service shop and repeated the 
		process. After another 30 seconds, that brand of transmission fluid 
		began smoking badly.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Now it's AMSOIL's turn and I must admit I thought my fluid was going to 
		smoke out just like the others with that direct flame,&quot; said Licht.<br>
		<br>
		Naranjo held the flame on the AMSOIL ATF for over two and a half minutes 
		and there was absolutely no smoke.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;He quickly turned to me and said he'd take a 30-gallon and a 55-gallon 
		drum of the ATF,&quot; said Licht. &quot;We couldn't believe our eyes!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Now Jimmy's Service stocks the entire XL line of oils, all of the AMSOIL 
		25,000-mile oils, AMSOIL diesel oils and all of the AMSOIL diesel 
		additives. The shop also carries AMSOIL filters, 2-cycle oils, Power 
		Foam Engine Cleaner and Home Heating Fuel Extender.</p>

		<br>
		Owners of motorhomes, who often travel long distances, are particularly 
		concerned with finding ways to save on fuel costs.<br>
		<br>
		A Texas man discovered AMSOIL motor oils and lubricants lived up to all 
		of his expectations in a journey from Texas to Alaska and back in 2004.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I have a 1998 Dutch Star by Newmar 38-foot motorhome with a 300 horse 
		power Cat engine,&quot; said Shelby Rash, Richardson, Texas. &quot;I also tow a 
		car behind.&quot; Throughout 2003,
		Rash averaged 7.1 miles per gallon.
		&quot;I use AMSOIL products and believe in them,&quot; Rash said.<br>
		<br>
		He took <a href="ame.htm">AMSOIL 15W-40 Heavy Duty Diesel and Marine Oil,</a>
		<a href="eao.htm">an AMSOIL oil 
		filter</a>, <a href="atd.htm">Torque-Drive Synthetic Automatic Transmission Fluid</a>,
		<a href="svg.htm">AMSOIL 
		75W-90 Synthetic Gear Lube</a>, <a href="atf.htm">AMSOIL Universal Automatic Transmission 
		Fluid</a>, for power steering/hydraulics, and the AMSOIL Synthetic 
		Multi-Purpose Grease to a shop in Dallas in January 2004.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;They installed AMSOIL in everything, including the grease fittings,&quot; 
		Rash said. &quot;I installed a new AMSOIL air filter and oiled the front wet 
		axles myself. I filled up with diesel and added AMSOIL Cetane Boost and 
		Diesel Fuel Additive to the tank, as well.&quot;
		Then Rash took his four-month, 11,000-mile trip.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I used the two additives each time I filled,&quot; he said. &quot;I also attended 
		two RV rallies where I 'dry-camped with a generator' for a total of 10 
		days during this time.&quot; The only thing he did was change the oil filter 
		during that time.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I averaged 8.6 mpg since January 2004 for these 11,000 miles,&quot; Rash 
		said. &quot;This sure helped with the high fuel prices. Just by changing to 
		AMSOIL I averaged 1.5 mpg better.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Is AMSOIL worth a try? I think so.&quot;</p>
