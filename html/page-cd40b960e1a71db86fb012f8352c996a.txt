<p class="introduction">Ford hit a grand slam two years ago with the introduction of an all-new Ford Fusion Hybrid. It was awarded the North American Car of the Year prize at the 2010 Detroit auto show, named Motor Trend’s Car of the Year, was one of Car and Driver magazine’s “10 Best Cars for 2010” and was given the inaugural Hermance Vehicle Efficiency Award by the publishers of HybridCars.com.</p>
<p>Why did the Fusion Hybrid rack up so many awards? Because the vehicle established a new benchmark in hybrid technology. Marrying a seamless, sophisticated hybrid powertrain to the outstanding Fusion platform – positioned solidly in the middle of the mainstream market – proved to be a winning combination. It’s fun to drive and speaks of refinement all around, from handling and braking through comfort and convenience. And then there was the icing on the cake – class-leading fuel economy of 41 city/36 highway and 39 combined.</p>

<p>But Ford is not resting on its laurels. An all-new 2013 Fusion Hybrid will be in dealer showrooms this fall. It not only ups the fuel economy numbers to an expected 47 city/44 highway, it is blessed with the styling of the gasoline-powered Fusion that auto critics are calling the best-looking midsize car, bar none.</p>
<p>Given that the 2013 Fusion Hybrid arrives later this year, there are no changes for the 2012 Fusion Hybrid.</p>
<h2>Correcting the Bad Rap Against Hybrids</h2>
<p>“The Toyota Prius and other hybrids are great for eco-geeks who hold fuel efficiency, low emissions and high-tech auto technology as sacrosanct – and all other car features as sacrifice. But drivers looking for a smooth, comfortable ride – with a modicum of style and performance – might as well forget hybrids.” So went the opinion of many auto journalists who historically dinged hybrids for lackluster driving characteristics, squishy brakes, and clunky transitions between gas and electric power. But that was before the Ford Fusion Hybrid, a family sedan that offers 41 mpg in the city – and more importantly, some fun and refinement behind the wheel.</p>
<p>USA Today emphatically stated, “The Ford Fusion Hybrid is the best gasoline-electric hybrid yet.” And Car and Driver said, “High mpg is a hybrid must, but the Fusion interpretation adds a modicum of fun-to-drive, thanks to precise steering.”</p>
<h2>From Gas to Electric and Back</h2>
<p>Ford engineers did a remarkable job of eliminating the flutter-rumble that many hybrids make when transitioning from gas engine to electric mode. In the Fusion Hybrid, the gasoline engine seamlessly starts up and shuts down “with only the very faintest shudder” according to Automobile magazine. USA Today goes further: “There was no – none, nada, zip – vibration or shimmying in the test car when the gasoline kicked in to help the electric. No other hybrid – not even that $112,000 Lexus – can make that claim 100 percent of the time.”</p>
<div class="fullWidthFigure"><img title="2012 Ford Fusion Hybrid" alt="Ford Fusion Hybrid" src="http://www.hybridcars.com/files/fusion-hybrid-badge-502.jpg" /></div>
<p>The Fusion Hybrid – and its sibling at the time, the Mercury Milan Hybrid – were the first vehicles to use Ford’s second-generation hybrid system. Hybrid-electric vehicle systems engineer Gil Portalatin told us that the control logic for the new hybrid system provides much tighter integration of engine operation and power delivery. The new logic goes as far as to vary the engine’s valve timing, fuel delivery, and spark timing to match the power delivered through the electric motor, permitting very aggressive fuel shutdown under light loads. As a result, the Fusion Hybrid’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine shuts itself off twice as often as the earlier hybrid design, with the electric system providing more power. In addition, new control logic for the regenerative brakes recaptures up to 94 percent of the braking energy and feeds it to the battery.</p>
<h2>Zesty Drive</h2>
<p>Enthusiasm from the auto press is also extended to the Fusion Hybrid’s road manners. Car and Driver said, “While most hybrids squeeze the fun out of driving, the Fusion has nicely weighted steering, a nimble chassis, and rides in a controlled, supple manner. You can hustle the car down a back road and get a smile on your face, which is not something one can say about the Camry hybrid.” Automobile magazine wrote, “Yeah, sure, there’s some of that artificialness in steering and braking responses that afflicts all hybrids, but it’s quite benign, and the car really does go down the road quite well. Anyone who’s shopping the Toyota Prius needs to check out this car also.” Nadaguides.com commented that the Fusion Hybrid’s 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine provides plenty of power for freeway ramps, while hugging the road and offering a comfortable ride.</p>
<p>The combined output for the Fusion Hybrid’s engine and motor is 191 horsepower. In addition to the Hybrid, the 2012 Ford Fusion lineup offers a choice of three different engines: a 2.5-liter inline-four with 175 horsepower; a 3.0-liter flex-fuel V-6 with 240 horsepower; and a performance-tuned 3.5-liter V-6 with 263 horsepower.</p>
<div class="fullWidthFigure"><img title="Ford Fusion Hybrid" alt="Ford Fusion Hybrid" src="http://www.hybridcars.com/files/fusion-hybrid-front-502.jpg" /></div>
<p>The one consistent criticism regarding the Fusion Hybrid’s drive is that Ford exaggerated with its claim that the sedan can go 47 miles per hour, and as much as two miles, in all-electric mode. That requires just the right conditions for acceleration, load, battery charge level, weather – and proper alignment of stars. Unless you exert extreme care to stretch the electric drive, you shouldn’t count on more than a few blocks at relatively low speeds.</p>
<h2>Exterior &amp; Interior Design</h2>
<p>The entire line of Ford Fusions – including the base S, mid-level SE, well equipped SEL, and the Fusion Hybrid – were spruced up for the 2010 model year. Car and Driver said, “The refresh makes the Fusion sharper looking, particularly since the weird headlamps of the original have been replaced.” Reviewers said the Fusion Hybrid looks like an uplevel Fusion SE or SEL. But not everybody likes the design. Bloomberg wrote, “From the lackluster rims, which look like they’re made of plastic, to the generic sedan shape, the Fusion has no flash whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interior, especially the high-tech features, gets mixed reviews, but mostly positive. Detroit News said, “The new instrument cluster looks much more sophisticated, and the dash has an easy flow. The touch points are soft, and every inch of the cabin uses high-quality materials. Car and Driver added, “Inside, the Fusion also receives a new instrument panel, redesigned seats, and more stylish trim, although the quality of some of the materials isn’t yet on par with those of the class leaders.”</p>
<div class="fullWidthFigure"><img title="Ford Fusion Hybrid" alt="Ford Fusion Hybrid" src="http://www.hybridcars.com/files/fusion-hybrid-int-502.jpg" /></div>
<p>The Fusion Hybrid offers Ford’s popular Sync voice-activated digital entertainment and integrated mobile phone system. Other options include blind-spot information mounted on the outside mirror, a backup camera screen cleverly hidden in the rearview mirror, cross-traffic alerts when reversing, and real-time traffic and weather through the Sirius Travel Link satellite radio system.</p>
<p>MyKey, added last year, will keep parents at ease when their teen drivers are behind the wheel. It chimes continuously when seat belts aren’t buckled, gives earlier low-fuel warnings, limits radio volume to 45 percent and can sound chimes at 45, 55 and 65 mph.</p>
<p>Standard features include bags, belts, 110-volt outlet, six-CD stereo (instead of the typical single setup), dual-zone climate control, auto on-off headlights, and auto-dimming mirror.</p>
<p>The Fusion Hybrid uses a new nickel metal hydride battery with 20 percent more power, in a package that’s 30-percent smaller. That means the Fusion Hybrid sacrifices only a negligible amount of trunk space compared to the standard version – but not enough to retain rear folding seats, which are not available in the Fusion Hybrid. The Camry Hybrid manages to keep folding back seats.</p>
<h2>Fusion Hybrid Comes With Fuel Economy Nag</h2>
<p>The 2012 Ford Fusion Hybrid continues with Ford’s SmartGauge technology. Inspired by the Toyota Prius’ hybrid energy/consumption monitor, the SmartGauge goes further by helping the driver to learn specific techniques to achieve higher efficiency. The dashboard interface offers feedback to the driver – both visual and sound. In other words, it actually talks to you.</p>
<div class="fullWidthFigure"><img title="Ford Fusion Hybrid" alt="Ford Fusion Hybrid" src="http://www.hybridcars.com/files/2012-Ford-Fusion-Hybrid-Gauges.jpg" /></div>
<p>The gauge cluster is comprised of dual hi-resolution LCD screens to display instantaneous mileage and fuel economy history – as well as key data including battery charge, engine output, and accessory power consumption. One animation depicts a vine of leaves that grows larger as the driver becomes more efficient over time. To prevent sensory overload, the system allows the driver to decide how much information to see, and what can be ignored. That’s critical, because many reviewers believe the fuel economy system is distracting. And others experienced &#8220;false alarms&#8221; from the cross-traffic alerts.</p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>If you like the Fusion Hybrid’s more dynamic handling and performance, and smoother hybrid system, compared to the Camry Hybrid, then get ready to pay for it. The 2012 Fusion Hybrid, with a base MSRP of $28,700 is $2,800 more than the 2012 Camry Hybrid LE and $1,300 more than the top line XLE model. Depending on the model, the Camry gets either more or less city fuel economy than the Fusion. Hyundai’s Sonata Hybrid is also several thousands less than the Fusion Hybrid and offers a sleek exterior plus generous interior features. The Sonata Hybrid has worse fuel economy than the Fusion Hybrid in the city, but its EPA-estimated highway fuel economy rating is better than the Fusion.</p>
<p>For reference, Ford’s other hybrid, the Escape Hybrid SUV, is comparably priced to the Fusion at $29,865 and offers fuel economy at 34 in the city and 31 on the highway. (Ford is dropping the Escape Hybrid in March.)</p>
<p>A dilemma is, should you buy a 2012 Fusion Hybrid or wait for the 2013 model with its stunning looks and improved fuel economy?</p>
<p>If you don’t place a premium on the latest styling or technology buy the 2012 Fusion Hybrid, it will serve you well. Plus, you can save money with the expected manufacturer incentives and dealer discounts as inventories of the 2012 model are cleared out to make way for the 2013 Fusion Hybrid.</p>
<p>Wait for the 2013 Fusion Hybrid if you want the advances in fuel economy, high-tech gear and safety features that accompany an all-new design. Waiting will also mean the car’s styling will look current for several years and it will be worth more at resale than the outgoing 2012 model.</p>

My only problem with this design is the stupid chrome bar right above the license plate, it makes it look like a cheap Chevy.  Other than that, I think Ford is definitely going in the right direction.  And I agree with Will that if any of the Big 3 were to be sasved, I&#8217;d vote for Ford.</p>

My perspective is that I&#8217;ve made my sacrifices (in comfort, stability, quietness) driving these small and very efficient cars.  I think I deserve something a little more comfortable than an Accent or other econobox. That&#8217;s why I spent less than $10k and bought a used 4 cyl Camry.  It is still relatively economical &#8211; I average about 33 mpg on the highway and it is very reliable. (I am not saying the Accent is not reliable).  </p>
<p>The Camry is also more comfortable and most importantly for me &#8211; quieter (less road noise, less engine noise and less wind noise). </p>
<p>I still say give credit where credit is due. I think Ford is doing the right thing with the hybrid Fusion. </p>

<p>In the 29 Oct 2008 hybridcars.com posting &#8220;Ford&#8217;s New Smarter Hybrids,&#8221; was the claim that &#8220;The Fusion Hybrid and Milan Hybrid can travel as a fast as 47 miles per hour, and as far as eight miles, solely on electric power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now they only claim pure electric for 1/4th as far. While many commute 8 miles or less, far fewer commute 2 miles or less.</p>

<p>FYI : 2010 Prius will give 10 % less mileage than current Prius, since it has 10 % more power.  Foolish decision on part of Toyota.  When summer comes, gas prices will top $3 again and if the economy recovers, it may top $4.</p>
<p>People want more mileage.  But Ford should also launch a Hybrid / Wagon / CUV version of these vehicles and those designs offer more space compared to sedan.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s remarkable that the Escape can go 2 miles in EV mode.  I understand that the Prius can&#8217;t go 1 mile and only then at half the speed.  To get increased distance, one mainly needs a larger, more expensive battery.  I wonder how Ford gets 2 miles. I doubt their battery is twice the size of the Prius.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if the U.S. auto industry dies, the balance of trade will become more imbalanced, the U.S. dollar would continue to lose value&#8211;not to mention the millions of unemployed in the U.S.  A bailout is the lessor of two evils, but I&#8217;m in favor of a lot of attached strings.</p>
<p>Gasoline will rise again, but it will be years before the price of oil significantly increases.  This economic downturn will last several more years.  However, i expect, and support, a significant Federal tax added to gasoline and diesel.  I support a $1 increase ASAP.</p>

<p>Now that Fords Quality is better than Toyota,</p>
<p>Both Consumer reports and JD rate fusion better than Camery.</p>

I&#8217;m drooling over this car (Fusion).  It has achieved significant strides over my car. I would love to have 2 mile EV range and 47mph EV. Bash all you want, this will be the clear leader in it&#8217;s class if it is sold in 09. </p>
<p>And those who follow the various hybrid sites know that the Escape hybrid has a tremendous rating among it&#8217;s owners. The biggest problem is that Ford is not making enough of them (and thus, dealers demanding a premium for them). But the vehicle itself is built and engineered as well (I believe better) than the Toyota. The A/C is now electric BTW were as it was originally run off the ICE, for the poster who was asking about this.</p>

<p>They have parts suppliers that provide parts for the escape hybrid that will supply parts to the Japanese first and then limit the amount of parts they provide to ford.</p>
<p>Ford was upset about this and when they developed this car they found some domestic suppliers for batteries and other components I believe.</p>

As for toyota and honda i still love them for having the only hybrid cars that have 40+ mpg on the city and highway and are priced at around 22,000 msrp of course. No otheir company has done that and honda and toyota have had reliable cars for 30+ years. I never heard of anyone that on know that has any type of problems with there toyota or honda.

I&#8217;ve owned two Toyotas and the second one, a 1998 Corolla which I still have, needed part of the transmission replaced at 70K miles (about $1.5K job) and is having problems again at 100K.  Very boring ride and awful handling by the way!  I&#8217;ve also owned a Honda S2000 (very fun car!) and a VW Jetta TDI which had several problems (about $2K in repairs so far).  A few months ago I bought a 2008 Ford Focus for my wife and that&#8217;s the funnest car (aside from the S2000) from them all!  Great handling, 34-35 mpg (comparable to the Corolla), much better features that the Corolla for a better price.  I bought it as a cheap option, but I didn&#8217;t think I would like that car as much as I do!  Of course, time will show how reliable it is, but it seems that Ford has made great strides in their reliability ratings so I&#8217;m being optimistic.

<p>Battery life is affected by depth of discharge, charge/discharge rate, operating temperature, etc. Discharging even modern NiMH batteries below 50% will shorten life, you want to cycle the battery between about 60-80% to promote good service life while staying below 80% in order to absorb additional energy which happen and preserve power electronics.</p>
<p>To a lay person 2 miles on 100% electric power may not seem like much, but to someone who works in the field, this is fantastic for a small storage system primarily designed to cyclically recover and release kinetic energy, thereby reducing fuel consumption by up to 30%. </p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t any production hybrids that can compete with this, and to add more batteries to existing systems would add both weight and considerable cost, well beyond the $27K or so price of the hybrid Fusion.</p>
<p>There will always be whiners and naysayers. Generally these people contribute very little to technological advances, but feel free to whine and complain when things aren&#8217;t perfect. Meanwhile the 10% of us or so forge ahead making new ideas a reality.</p>
<p>10 years from now, the average person will be glad that Ford, even during difficult times, along with Toyota, Honda, Nissan and to a lesser extent GM has invested in trying to make larger vehicles more fuel efficient.</p>
<p>There is more here than is obvious at first glance. Consider that both the Fusion and Altima hybrids may become the basis for hybrid taxis in the near future. Being able to shut down will stopped, then to run short distances on electric power will help reduce urban pollution considerably. </p>
<p>Try that with your Accent or similar econobox and you&#8217;d get laughed out of town.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14538" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>OK, I skipped over a LOT of these posts because there was just so much there, so maybe I&#8217;m duplicating someone else&#8217;s thoughts, but here&#8217;s my perspective:</p>
<p>I live in MN and my wife &#038; I both have been following the hybrid market for some time.  Last year we got married, bought a new house, and generally spent a bunch of money, so we haven&#8217;t entered the market yet.  I drive a 2005 SUV and she drives a 2004 SUV (we both had them before we got too serious).  We want to replace hers this year, and we certainly don&#8217;t need a 2nd SUV anymore, so we&#8217;re eyeing the hybrid car market pretty closely.  Since we live in MN, we get a fair amount of bad weather too.  So the Fusion hybrid appeals to us for several reasons:</p>
<p>1) Better gas mileage than the Camry, and significantly better than the Malibu.</p>
<p>2) We don&#8217;t feel like we have to sacrifice too much on space and driving like we might with a Prius or a Civic, or the reintroduced Insight.  We want to find a balance between responsibility and comfort, and this looks like it might be a good fit.</p>
<p>3) To my knowledge, this is the only hybrid sedan to date with the option for AWD, which we feel is important given our climate.  This is doubly important as we plan children in the near future.</p>
<p>I frequently see comments from the diehard hybrid fans lamenting the lack of mass market appeal of some of the vehicles.  As far as I&#8217;m concerned, this vehicle address just about all of my concerns for a hybrid, and I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s a better than 50/50 chance this will be our next vehicle.  Hybrids like this, in my opinion, are what will eventually bring the masses to the market, because I have to think there are a lot of people like us out there, who want a hybrid but also want it to fit into the realities of our life.  So in that context, I would think every hybrid fan should be happy about the Fusion.</p>

The truck was a stellar truck with an abysmal 13MPG. I just drove from Northern VA to Gettysburg PA in the new Fusion and got 200 miles to a quarter tank of gas! That was driving I-95 to 270 to 15.  Hardly any surface street in the whole trip.  I am almost to 400 miles now at a half tank of gas. I have never been so excited about a car with this kind of MPG, accessories and looks GREAT, unlike the jelly bean shaped souless Prius. If you stripped down a Fusion to the bare essentials like a Prius, it would get the same mileage and look way cooler!</p>

At 6&#8217;4&#8243; I was concerned about headroom with a moonroof, but it&#8217;s been roomy enough.  We got &#8216;bells and whistles&#8217; and they all work as advertized.  Cell phone Sync&#8217;d &#8211; and Nav unit got us there, though it&#8217;s a pity that the NAV unit doesn&#8217;t have the whole USA in it &#8211; but I&#8217;m sure there is software available for that.<br />
The backup camera is really handy and the alerting system saved my quarterpanels when someone was speeding by as I was leaving a parking slot.<br />
I thought that perhaps the climate control would affect the fuel efficiency.  We&#8217;re using AC continuously in Houston and (as a techno-nerd) I thought that I should be driving with it off &#8211; - soooo wrong!  I sit absolutely guilt-free at stop lights with AC functional and the internal combustion engine off &#8211; life is good.</p>
<p>There does seem to be some cycling of the charging system at about 45 or 50 mph steady state speed &#8211;  this can be a little annoying but it doesn&#8217;t seem to happen often&#8230;  <br />
I&#8217;m still on my second tank of fuel so experience is limited &#8211; but my record high is 50.6 MPG &#8211; the record low is 14.6 MPG.  My son and I had some &#8211; ah &#8211; quick accelerations (i.e. punched it).  It&#8217;s not a Mustang GT, but it did ok &#8211; and still got 24 MPG.<br />
Overall MPG is is about 37 &#8211; pretty much as advertized.</p>

A true turn around from old misconceptions of American cars.  Ford finally nailed it &#8211; great look, great handling, almost 200hp and I get better mpg&#8217;s than the EPA rated 36/41.  Using the on mpg indicators &#8211; I keep it around 40 on the highway, usually averaging 40-45mpg&#8217;s. </p>
<p>I got all the bells and whistles, but no Navigation &#8211; but thats ok!  Because the MS Sync has an update that now gives you turn by turn just by talking to it (and it works nicely).  </p>
<p>I see this as the American hybrid &#8211; no goofy look, good warranty (even better if you extend it like I did), and great mpg&#8217;s &#8211; as well as all the extras (heated leather, sony 12 speaker surround, moon roof).  All this without sacrificing the feeling of driving a real car (unlike most hybrids).</p>
<p>Feels more like a luxury car.  Well worth it.</p>

I do own a Chevy diesel truck (work vehicle) that routinely gets 25 mpg highway, which is amazing for a 7200# truck, and a gas-powered Maxima V6 that gets 30mpg highway.  I am considering a hybrid car to replace the Maxima when the time comes.  In my opinion, the two technologies are not competing, but complimentary.  Both have a place.  You can&#8217;t haul a cube of bricks down the interstate with a hybrid and a diesel isn&#8217;t well suited to short-haul city commuter driving.  </p>
<p>The secret to the Fusion&#8217;s (and Ford&#8217;s) success is that it is truly an international car company.  Unlike GM, Ford has fully brought together it&#8217;s Japanese, European, and American arms in sharing technology and platforms.  I would own a Fusion.  GM on the other hand is trying to shed Opel/Vauxhall and has never succeeded in merging it&#8217;s various international divisions, and Chrysler? &#8230; not a clue, even with FIAT.</p>

Case in point, I (still) drive a 1998 4 cyl 5 speed FORD Ranger, and before gasoline was diluted with ethanol (a corn-derived alcohol in the US, probably one of the worst things the govt has proposed to the oil industry), I could get 30mpg on the highway; now with 10% ethanol mileage has dropped to about 25mpg. The added cost of a hybrid, as well as the battery and other costly maintenance does not seem worth the price, unless efficiency is above 50mpg, something that I believe is achievable with diesel and diesel electric hybrids. Until such a time as those vehicles are available, I will drive my Ford Ranger and my Buell XB12ss (circa 55mpg). </p>

The parts are made in the US and Canada and is assembled in Mexico (all parts of NAFTA and in my book thus &#8220;domestic&#8221;). We have had absolutely no problems with this car. The gas mileage is superior. During the fall when the temperatures were above freezing I get 40+ mpg driving between 65 and 70 mph. Now that it is in the upper teens I get around 32 mpg on the first drive of the day (under 10 miles) but then after the engine and passenger compartment are warmed up the mileage goes up to 37-8 mpg. The car is called a &#8220;mid-sized&#8221; but has nearly as much internal room as did my old &#8220;full-sized&#8221; Ford 500. Since 2000 I have found the Fords I have owned to be of better quality and more trouble free than the two Toyotas and the Honda that I owned. The only issue that the 500 had was a recall on the brakes (from an outside supplier) which Ford completely replace (front and rear &#8211; rotors and all) for free and gave me a &#8216;loaner&#8221; while the 500 was in the shop. There have been absolutely no problems with the Fusion Hybrid so far. The hybrid power train is fully covered for 300K so I have no worries about it as I rarely keep a vehicle beyond 100K.</p>
<p>Real experience is showing that Ford builds some of the highest quality cars made, makes them in the US, and keeps the profit in the US. Ford and its suppliers pay their workers a fair wage and provide good benefits. These workers are here in the US and our Canadian and Mexican neighbors, not in some sweatshop in Asia! It is time for Americans to purchase North American made goods from North American companies to keep these jobs in the US and the members of NAFTA! Once the government gets its money out of Chrysler (if it survives) it will be an Italian company and given its record for quality I wouldn&#8217;t suggest that we consider it anything but a &#8220;foreign&#8221; auto maker. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14550" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You argument is severely flawed. How is a car that is made in Mexico more domestic than a car made in Japan? Made in Mexico is not made in the USA. Many Japanese companies actually have US assembly plants. Toyota actually has a plant 4 miles down the road from me and employs 30% of the people that lives in my town. I prefer cars to have parts manufactured in the US and be assembled in the US as well. The manufacturing of parts is way more automated than the assembly of cars thus requires much less labor. So essentially for the Ford Fusion that you bought most of the automated processes occurred in the US while most of the labor(which employs the most people) occurred in Mexico. I much rather buy a Toyota manufactured in the US than a Ford manufactured in Mexico.</p>
<p>And sweatshops? Are you thinking of Malaysia or Indonesia? There are no sweatshops in Japan. Let me remind you that Japan is the #2 economy in the world and the average household income is comparable to the US and MUCH MUCH higher than Mexico. Having been to both countries I can tell you that Mexico is very much a low-waged and developing country while Japan has a very technologically advanced and wealthy society. Before med school one of my goals was to teach English abroad for 2 years and the offer I received from a school in Tokyo paid 43,000 US dollars annually while Mexico and Costa Rica opportunities offered $4000 and $1200, respectively. I&#8217;m only bringing this up because  Ford is paying much less for workers in Mexico than Toyota and Honda are paying their workers in Japan. They are just more efficient companies and have the management to squeeze out more profit from the cars they sell. </p>
<p>The best scenario is to have parts made in US, cars assembled in the US, and profit flowing to the US. But I&#8217;m not sure a Ford assembled in Chihuahua, Mexico is a better situation than a Toyota assembled in Alabama. </p>

It definately deserves the car of the year award.  Prior to purchase my wife and I drove the Honda Insight and Civic as well as the Prius and hands down we both loved the Fusion.  It handled much better than the other vehicles as well as had more room.  We are using it as a primary car for our family and the kids have plenty of room in the back.  The transitions from electic to gas ais seemless.  The Sync system is very nice and takes a while to learn as I haven&#8217;t mastered it as of yet.  The car also looks really sporty and my wife even walked to the same color BMW 3 series by mistake in the parking lot a few weeks ago.  Great job Ford!</p>

<p>I was trolling new car dealers today and I was astounded to long rows of new 2010 Priuses lined up at several dealers, stickers in the windows indicating 100% origin in Japan, that means labor, parts, assembly the whole thing.  I had been under the impression that Toyota had moved essentially all operations to this country, to look as “domestic” as possible and to protect itself from currency fluctuations.  So what is this, is this a new thing for Toyota that has not been noticed yet.  It should be noted that all these stickers can be removed once it has been sold to the consumer and lots of people might not even notice the difference.</p>

I bought a 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid and experienceing problems with it and now I am stuck.  The first problem: I keep on getting a message that tells me that the blind spot is disabled and to check the owner&#8217;s manual.  I have taken it to the dealer a couple of times.  The last time they were honest enough to tell me that there is nothing they can do about it because they are not able to find any problems nor replicate with ramdom messages I get.  This error message pops up under any weather condition and the blind spot light stays lit unti I turn off the car and turn it back on.  Now, the newest thing is that my phone gets picked up when I turn on the car (which is what is supposed to do) but about 3 mins later, the phone gets disconnected&#8230;. which is not supposed to happen. I am fully aware that these problems do not keep me from moving from point A to point B but it bothers to know that I have a defective new vehicle and not much help available at this point.<br />
   I am very frustrated with this car and Ford for that matter since this is the 2nd brand new Ford I buy and yes&#8230;. problems with both.  There would not be a 3rd Ford&#8230;.. that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Anyone else has had any issues similar to these?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14581" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Really like my Fusion hybrid far more than anticiapted. Looks good and handles well for a front drive car. First tank of gas averaged 40.2mpg and the seccond 41.5 mpg. I use the display that shows the tach and when starting out, keep it at 2000 rpm to achieve the numbers. At that rpm it accelerates moderately without getting people behind PO&#8217;d. Getting the engine warmed up is required to get good mpg as a 3-4 mile commute will have mileage suffer. My car has everything but the premium sound/navagation. For the money, i can get a gps for 100 with lifetime updates. Got a 2010 end of year with 2k rebate/discount. The care gets good mileag if you anticipate more when comming to stop lights by lifting off the throttle so that it can also charge the battery. The gas saved is how much the battery helps get up to speed and if nobody is  behind and you can keep it in the green ev mode you will be surprised. Don&#8217;t accelerate fast and the mileage will exceed the EPA numbers. I expect it will improve after it is broken in. BTW i have had it accelerate to 47 mph on battery alone numerous times, however if you set cruise at 30 in town, it will stay in electric mode far longer. It takes extra energy to to go 47 mph over 30 in part to overcome wind resistance, just like riding a  bicycle.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14588" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;ve had my 2010 Fusion Hybrid since December 2009.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting a long term average MPG of 40.0 now after about 25,000 miles.</p>
<p>My daily commute is 41 miles each way.  Of which about 11 Miles is below HWY speeds and 30 miles is at 65-70MPH.<br />
My best morning MPG with the lights on is about 41MPG, my best afternoon MPG is 46.9MPG.</p>
<p>With the exception of my 3 mile commute to my local grocery at 30MPH where I&#8217;ve gotten from 70-99.9MPH I don&#8217;t really try to feather that much.  What I do do is:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t jackrabbit my starts.  It&#8217;s suprising the difference in performace as well as milage when you provide a steady increase in force on the accellerator vs. flooring it.  When you floor it there is a lag effect not unlike that with a turbo or a blower, where the RPMs go way up and THEN accelleration kicks in.<br />
A steady increase in accelleration allows the electric and gas power to stay more in sync and actually provides better overall accelleration as well as fuel economy.</p>
<p>As soon as I get to speed I set the cruise control.  Letting the vehicle manage the best way to maintain speed seems to increase the efficiency a great deal.  I can still pass; I can go from 65-75/80 easily in passing a single car if necessary.</p>
<p>I keep my Accessory usage to a minimum, including AC.  I am almost always listening to the radio, but when I listen to my latest Ozzy CD at max volume I loose about 1-3 MPG!  Keeping the AC/Heater off with the moonroof in vent mode also seems to give me a boost in MPG.  During the summer time in Florida this is not an option so my MPG suffers, to the tune of 38-39 averaged MPG.</p>
<p>Additionally, this is a nice riding vehicle.  I&#8217;ve run it with and without the traction control on.  Much more fun with it off&#8230; <img src='http://www.hybridcars.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> <br />
I can also say that I recently exceeded 95 MPH and the ride and handling are still very good.</p>
<p>Now is it the same as my &#8217;99 Toyota Solara V6 SLE with Kazuma TRD upgrades?  Not a chance, but then I was getting around 20MPG round trip.</p>

From a driver&#8217;s point of view, Ford did the right thing with the analog speedo.  When driving in intense conditions, you don&#8217;t want to worry about the fact that the human bring takes longer to read and interpret the digits meaning.  Your bring reacts much faster with the visual of the analog needle without any need to see the numbers.</p>

Than after getting our first Light bill with this new wonder installed came to $289 (round figure). <br />
True we have saved ourselves well over $400 so far for the first month of service but I supposed depending on your driving habits it could cost your more or it could cost you less.<br />
Either way this is NOT going to work because the next person getting this car when I trade it in will have to go through the same thing.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14601" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I gave up my Lexus GS and &#8220;stepped down&#8221; to a Fusion Hybrid.  This car is the most fun and I no longer care to drive our BMW (which I plan to dump for a Lincoln Hybrid by next year).</p>
<p>This is not only the first American car I&#8217;ve owned in 30 years, it is the first Ford I have ever owned.</p>
<p>After researching this Fusion, along with all other competitive products that were either available or close to becoming available, I was convinced that Ford had really done their homework and I was right.  There is nothing I can find (and I have really, really, really tried) that I would suggest they add to this car!</p>
<p>First&#8230;the white &#8220;tricoat paint&#8221; I paid for looks magnificent&#8230;every day.  The light colored leather seats are also nice.  The Sync system only took me about 45 days to master (!) and that&#8217;s with 25 years of background in the consumer electronics industry! I love it more every day.</p>
<p>About the mileage&#8230;I think Ford understated the MPG.  With a little bit of practice, I am able to consistently get in excess of the 41 MPG they quote.  It did take a little getting used to, but it is fun seeing whether I can get the mileage over 44 and keep it there for a tankful of gas.  And how did all this start?</p>
<p>I noticed on a recent trip down the Florida Turnpike that my mileage increased dramatically if I was able to slow down at bit. You are almost compelled to drive at the speed limit to avoid being rear ended, but I also noticed that the Fusion display displayed significantly better mileage whenever I was able to slow down. So&#8230;</p>
<p>I tested a reduced speed plan for the rest of the trip, with the  following result:  At 55 mph, I got 44 miles per gallon.  At 70, I got 37miles per gallon. </p>
<p>I felt compelled to give someone a suggestion that we reduce all the speed limits to 55 (again), and wrote to the Washington Post:  I&#8217;m sure someone at the Washington Post can do the math better than I can, but don&#8217;t stop there&#8230;  Just think about the revenue from the speeders.  Win.  Win!  We get reduced gas usage if all the Federal Highway speed limits are reduced to 55mph AND more revenue for the State treasuries at the same time.  What a deal AND the President might actually get it through Congress in less than a week because I think any Congressman or Senator would have difficult voting against this (but I&#8217;d love to see who would).</p>
<p>By the way, it took me about 15 minutes longer to reach my destination and cost about $2.50 less.  Some sacrifice, huh?</p>

The Ford Fusion Hybrid certainly seems to be an ideal answer for a smooth drive and though Ford did have a lot of issues some time back, I’ve been using my Ford Escape for the past four years and I’ve been very happy with it!! I will definitely opt for the Ford Fusion Hybrid if I am able to dispose this one off for a good price!!</p>

FUSION HYBRID AVERAGES 81.5 MPG, SETS WORLD RECORD WITH 1,445 MILES ON SINGLE TANK OF GAS. Man this is brilliant! Why would people buy a VOLT which is more than $10,000 more &#038; charging electric cars are not always a practical option. It takes time to charge, unlike hair loss supplements filling-up gas in stations which will only take a few minutes. Sure the Volt has been computed to have a 320 mpg rating if your daily use is below 40 miles per day, which 80% of Americans do. The 80 -20 rule was why they aimed at 40 miles for electric driving. If 80% of Americans drove 45 miles per day the Volt would be aimed at 45 miles of electric driving. The ford fusion hybrid sort of reminds me about of a gasoline sedan with diesel like compact European cars mileage.</p>

Have a battery that can do 20 -40 miles.  Have electric motors/generators for drive and regenerative braking. Engine comes on at 20% and shuts off at 100% or can be overridden by driver when he/she will be able to get home and charge better.  No drive shafts, no transmisson, no universal joints or cvc joints.  Should have enough power for acceleration and enough to cruise the highway at highway speed.  The engine operation can be set optimally as it will run at one preset rpm always.  Design battery compartment to accomodate any new battery technology.</p>

<p>No great performance and it is a station wagon&#8211;but when it comes to cheap transportation that is cheap on gass&#8211;it is a far cheaper alternative.</p>
<p>My question is, if Ford could design a 40 mpg car in &#8217;95-&#8217;98, why can&#8217;t they figure this out for more models now?</p>
<p>My guess is all the EPA and Nat&#8217;l Tranpsortation Safety Commission requirements make the cars too heavy and choke the heck out of the engines&#8230;</p>

The dealer where I bought the car from has been trying their best in correcting the problem with no success.  The dealer has now called in a Ford Technician from Michigan to work on my car.  I bought the car in Nov 2010 as an inventory car with only 10 miles driven.  I only have owned it for one year and now I have this problem.  The car runs good and normal even though the engine light comes on.  I am wondering if there are other Fusion Hybrid owners who are experiencing this problem. The engine light concerns me because when I do have a real engine problem, I would not be able to tell.</p>
<p>In addition to the engine light problem, my car continuously registers a phantom car on the cross traffic sensors on the side mirrors.  I keep bringing the car in to have the computer adjusted.  The dealership says that obstacles on the road like radars, middle medium on highway, a sign, etc can cause the sensor to malfunction temporarily.  Are there other fusion hybrid owners out there who are experiencing this problem?</p>
<p>Thankfully my car dealership has been very accommodating and helpful in trying their best to solve my problem.  I happen to have taken a six year MPP protection plan when I bought my car, and all service calls have been covered so far.<br />
This is too scary.  An expensive car owned for one year already experiencing these types of problems.</p>

Love the car to pieces, but wish it had a fold-down rear seat and a memory seat for the driver.  Almost purchased the Lincoln MKZ hybrid but liked the Fusion interior much better.  No problems to report, but we had to call the dealership for assistance with the Navigation system.  The Garmin GPS systems are much easier to activate and use. </p>
<p>High points in the car are the backup camera and backup sensors, the voice activated phone/entertainment system (serius)/travel link for fuel prices ahead/weather radar/movie start times/comfortable solid ride &#038; fuel economy always around 40 mpg. Wish it had greater range on battery alone for short trips, but the engine starts to warm the car on cold days even when using the battery to drive. </p>
<p>Negative points include: No down-hill engine braking on long down grades.  We have to ride the brakes to keep the vehicle under control (85 mph + and accelerating is not safe on the interstates !)  Free and frequent up- dating of the GPS data base should be part of the whole package for a $33K midsize American car).  Newer food outlets and POIs do appear every year.  </p>
<p>But overall a great car that we would buy again in a couple of years.  Keep up the good work.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14637" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Have been driving our 2010 FF hybrid for a year now (early December purchase) and are now at 15 K miles + including several trips to FL and SC from Ohio.  Love the car to pieces, but wish it had a fold-down rear seat and a memory seat for the driver.  Almost purchased the Lincoln MKZ hybrid but liked the Fusion interior much better.  No problems to report, but we had to call the dealership for assistance with the Navigation system.  The Garmin GPS systems are much easier to activate and use. </p>
<p>High points in the car are the backup camera and backup sensors, the voice activated phone/entertainment system (serius)/travel link for fuel prices ahead/weather radar/movie start times/comfortable solid ride &#038; fuel economy always around 40 mpg. Wish it had greater range on battery alone for short trips, but the engine starts to warm the car on cold days even when using the battery to drive. </p>
<p>Negative points include: No down-hill engine braking on long down grades.  We have to ride the brakes to keep the vehicle under control (85 mph + and accelerating is not safe on the interstates !)  Free and frequent up- dating of the GPS data base should be part of the whole package for a $33K midsize American car).  Newer food outlets and POIs do appear every year.  </p>
<p>But overall a great car that we would buy again in a couple of years.  Keep up the good work.</p>

That was until a local Toyota salesman stated &#8220;if you are considering a Ford hybrid, you just might want to wait until the release of the new 2012 Camry hybrid which will be mechanically re-engineered and cost less than Toyota&#8217;s 2011 models.&#8221;  Bottom line, ~ I waited until December and bought a 2012 Toyota Camry hybrid because 1) better interior design without all the cheap looking Ford dashboard lights, 2) larger trunk space, 3) an engine with no belts, 4) better EPA estimated overall vehicle gas mileage and 5) a savings of almost $3,500 less than the cost of a Ford hybrid!!!  Note: Did not consider the Hyundai Sonata hybrid because reviews did not warrant the effort needed to drive out of our local area to find a dealer.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14640" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Dear Sir/Madam, <br />
My name is Engin Agac and I am from Turkey. I learned that many companies have developed a device that prevents drunk driving. The devices look like significant but I still believe that this is not a final solution for the problem. I have prepared a project about this subject. I believe that the project that I prepared provides 100% solution.<br />
The important points of my project are shown below:<br />
THE DEVICE PREVENTING DRUNK DRIVING<br />
1) The drunk driver can never start the car as he cannot pass the alcohol test.<br />
2) The device can detect the difference when the non-drunk driver changes place with a drunk driver.<br />
3) If the driver starts the car and begins drinking alcoholic beverages the device detects this.<br />
4) The driver is kept under control automatically and during every stop and run.<br />
5) The driver should take and pass the alcohol test every day.<br />
6) If the driver should be changed then the new driver should pass the alcohol test.,<br />
7) If any other person except the driver drinks alcoholic beverages, this will not stop the car or will not prevent the driver from starting the engine.<br />
8) In case the driver &#8220;must&#8221; start the car even though he is drunk, he should define himself as &#8220;drunk&#8221; to the device. The device will not question if the driver is drunk or not in this situation. By this way the device sets a maximum speed limit and the flashers are turned on. If the driver tries to exceed the speed limit the car stops and the lights continue flashing.<br />
Detailed Explanations for some articles above:<br />
Article 2) If the non-drunk driver changes place with a drunk driver then the device will detect this. For example Robert is drunk and Matthias is sober. In this situation only Matthias can start the car and Robert cannot pass the test. If Robert wants to drive while the engine is running, the device will detect that it was Matthias who started the car and will not let Robert to drive. The device will recognize that Robert has changed place and came to the driver seat. In this situation it asks the test to be taken by the new driver. If he cannot pass the test, then the car will be stopped after the warnings.<br />
Article 3) Example: Robert is not drunk until he starts the car but he starts drinking while driving. At this point the device will detect the smell and ask the driver to take the test again. If the driver is drunk, then the car will stop after the warnings.<br />
Article 4) The driver who started the engine is always under control as he should take the test at every stop and run. The device checks the driver change at every stop and run, while the car is started. If one driver passes the test and start the car, and if he wants to change the seat to someone else after a while, the device checks if someone else has come to the driver seat. This control will be done at every stop and run. But if it is requested, this can be applied at certain time periods through the settings of the device.<br />
Article 5) In this project the driver must take the alcohol test every day.<br />
But if we develop the software we can achieve something like this:<br />
1) If a driver never drinks alcohol and a driver change will never be done, the driver may take the test only once a year, once in ten years or he may not take the test during his whole lifetime. This driver needs to take the test only once. But this article makes it necessary for the driver to take the test if someone else but the driver drinks alcohol in the vehicle.<br />
2) Let&#8217;s think of a family consisting of father, mother, two sons and one daughter. One of the sons drink alcohol frequently but the other drinks only on new years. Father, mother and the daughter never drink alcohol and this family owns a car. How does the device works in this case? Should the alcohol test be taken every day? No, it is not. The device can recognize the members of the family. This means that the device cen keep in its memory who is a drinker and who is a non-drinker. The device can also detect that the person who did not drink alcohol for a long time is now drunk and it notifies the driver that the test should be taken. Thanks to the software that has been developed, father-mother and the daughter should take the test only once and they do not need to take the test again during their lifetime. While the father, mother or the daughter drives the car, someone else in the vehicle should not drink alcoholic beverages. Otherwise they need to take the alcohol test. This situation does not prevent the car from running or does not stop the running car.<br />
Article 6) A driver change can only be done when the engine is stopped. The new driver should pass the test before starting the car. The driver change cannot be applied after the engine is started.<br />
Article 7) Let&#8217;s say there are 4 people in the car (One driver and three passengers). The driver is sober and did not drink any alcoholic beverages. Even though the passengers are drinking, the alcohol smell will not prevent the car from starting nor the engine will not be stopped. <br />
- For the car to be stopped: <br />
* As the alcohol smell is detected, the driver is asked to take the test.<br />
** The driver must take this test. Otherwise the car speed will be decreased and it will be stopped after the warnings.<br />
*** If the driver is drunk as he takes the test, the car speed will be decreased and it will be stopped after the warnings again.<br />
**** The device always warns the driver before stopping the car. If the driver denies the warnings then the car will be stopped.<br />
The software scheme of this device is already prepared. Alcoholmeter and smell sensors are the components of this device. But the important point is that a software to achieve these functions. As the scheme is already done, the software needs to be written by your company.  <br />
THE DEVICE PREVENTING TO DRIVE WITHOUT DRIVING LICENSE<br />
To prevent driving without driving license can be achieved only if the driver licenses are renewed so that it can interact with the device that is to be installed in the car.<br />
1) A person without the driving license can never start the car.<br />
2) A person without the driving license can never drive a car in motion.<br />
3) If the driver wants to change place with another driver without a license, this will be detected by the device and the car will be stopped if the warning is ignored.<br />
4) The driver will be kept under control every second and he can never drive the car without the license.<br />
5) The driver should take the driving license test once a day.<br />
6) One driver can never use someone else&#8217;s license.<br />
7) If a driver change is needed, then the new driver should take the test.<br />
8) At every getting on and off a control is not applied. The test is only applied in case of a driver change.<br />
As you know I am not a mechanical technician or engineer and I cannot explain the details of my project by using scientific terms. But I can describe all details of my project.<br />
Although alcoholmeter and smell sensors will be used in this project, not only these two devices will be functioning. The most important characteristic that differs my project from the others is that this device will be software assisted. I mean each article describing the features of the project will be assisted by a software.<br />
My aim is to offer you the patent of this project to your company. If you are interested you can also contact me online, by phone or come to Istanbul and I can explain this project to you personally.<br />
Detailed explanation and software schemes for both projects are available. <br />
I will be expecting your soonest reply if you are interested in my projects.<br />
Kind Regards,<br />

Although it is virtually the same car as the Fusion, and more expensive, it is well worth the difference.<br />
Along with the 41mpg around town, 37mpg on the road, the 17 inch wheels and great interior,it drives like the luxury car that it is.<br />
We look forward to taking our yearly road trip this summer and enjoying the comfort and economy.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14654" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>We bought a 2012 Fusion Hybrid recently after seeing the 2013 FFH photos; no thanks!  The new one looks like a fat Hyundai Sonata (yuck) and the Fusion loses its good looks. The new interior has a swooping giant center console (like the Taurus) which really impedes knee room where the console bends. And it looks like the window line is higher, reducing visibility.  Horsepower is reduced to 185 from 191. The mpg is claimed to be better, but heck we get 45-50 mpg now!<br />
Why did they have to mess up a fine design?  I hope that they fixed the trunk space, at least something positive may come of it.</p>

offer a good trunk unlike the Focus EV.</p>

<p>The Maxi in particular will offer good accomodation for 5 people, and the Fusion should be a worthy alternative for those preferring a sedan.<br />
If they are priced competitively then their release in the autumn should be quite a landmark.</p>

The car is a constant challenge to see if one can optimize their mileage. I bought this car to tow behind my motor home. It tows well but 7 out 8 times I&#8217;ve had to jump start this car when arriving at my destination. It&#8217;s easy with my portable battery; however it is inconvenient. Ford has tested the battery and has done a diagnostics check finding no problems. Ford engineering has been unable suggest a fuse to pull to eliminate the battery decay. They suggest disconnecting the battery, which is still not convenient. If anyone else has experienced this problem , please comment. </p>

I have had it in the shop severals times for loss of power, after spending $700 the first time that was not the problem, very disapointing!  With that said ouw Ford garage has wonderful customer service, super nice people.  One other problem I have had since day 1 is a hole in my carpet under my gas pedal, it has been replaced every 10,000 miles and after 3 times I said I would deal with the hole because they have scrached my door jams and everything is squeaky and loose from taking the seats in and out, I asked to just fix the hole and ford says no, all new carpet or nothing, no common since.  They also tell me I am &#8220;the only one&#8221; this has happened to, I would like to hear from you all to see if this is true.<br />
I love the car, design, space etc&#8230;but bying to every buy any Ford again would take alot of thought, we also have a 08 350 Duley that has had every replaced and just spent anoth 1600 today on a radiator, with only 75,000 miles, really!!!!!!</p>

The reason is that this Atkinson engine is more efficient at lower RPMs, and so with the more powerful engine, it&#8217;s average RPM with the CVT transmission is going to be lower, hence more MPG. The proof is in the EPA numbers and also the real world numbers on Fuelly.</p>
<p>Wait for HCCI engines in hybrids, they will bring even more MPG than the Atkinson-miller cycle engines in hybrids today.</p>

Lots of American people still keep thinking foreign cars are better particularly Toyota. USA car makers have made tremendous progress over the past decates, and today, USA cars are just as good as foreign cars. We should give them a chance. Imagine this, if most of us start buying USA made cars, we shall solve the unemployment problem very quickly.</p>

Great job for publishing such a beneficial web site. Your web log isn’t only useful but it is additionally really creative too. There tend to be not many people who can certainly write not so simple posts that artistically. Continue the nice writing<br />

<p>- The Fusion has a really cool &#8220;Aston Martinish&#8221; grill.<br />
- The Camry has 12 more horsepower, weighs 303 pounds less, and gets to 60mph 27% faster than the Fusion (7.2 seconds vs. 9.1 seconds).<br />
- The Fusion has a more &#8220;high tech, lighter, smaller Li-ion battery pack&#8221; that somehow takes up 4 cubic feet, leaving a trunk that is more than 1 cubic foot smaller than the Camry&#8217;s (12 cubic feet vs. 13.1 cubic feet).<br />
  &#8211; The Camry&#8217;s trunk is 2.3 cubic feet smaller than the standard Camry, while the Fusion&#8217;s trunk is 4 cubic feet smaller than the standard Fusion. How is this technology smaller?<br />
  &#8211; The Camry hybrid weighs 177 pounds more than the non-hybrid Camry, while the Fusion hybrid weighs 293 pounds more than the non-hybrid Fusion.  How is this technology lighter?<br />
- The Fusion is rated at 47mpg, and the Camry 41mpg; however, the Camry actually gets 41mpg, and the Fusion gets less.<br />
  &#8211; This is especially bad for the Fusion, because it has a tiny gas tank, 26% smaller than the Camry&#8217;s (13.5 gallons vs. 17 gallons).<br />
- The Camry has more back seat headroom.<br />
- The Fusion Hybrid costs $2,000 more than the Camry Hybrid.<br />
- The Camry is made in Kentucky, while the Fusion is made in Mexico.<br />
- The Fusion has a really cool &#8220;Aston Martinish&#8221; grill (repeated, I know, but people are really excited about the grill).</p>
